<p><span class="smcap">Lord</span> Munster devoted himself entirely to ambition: what has
been said of Cinna might be applied to him, <i>he had a head to
contrive, a tongue to persuade, and a hand to execute any mischief</i>.
Weak people are only wicked by halves; and whenever we hear of
high and enormous crimes, we may conclude that they proceeded
from a power of soul, and a reach of thought, that are altogether
unusual.</p>

<p>He stuck at nothing to accomplish his political plans; and his
success rendered him still more enterprising: But being at last
refused a favor from his Sovereign, he retired disgusted with the
court, and in vain sought that happiness in a retreat, which his
crimes made it impossible he should ever find. He was so
chagrined that everything became intolerable to him; and he
continually vented his spleen on those of his friends, whose
circumstances rendered them subservient to his caprices. He
possessed good health, a large estate, and had fine children, that
equalled his most sanguine expectations. In the opinion of the
world, therefore, he was a <em>very happy man</em>, but in his own, <i>quite the
contrary</i>. No man can judge of the happiness or infelicity of his
neighbour. We only know the external causes of good and evil,
which causes are not always proportionable to their effects: those
which seem to us small, often occasion a strong sensation; and
those which appear to us great, often produce only a faint
sensation. The great advantages Lord Munster possessed, as they
excited in him only indifference, in reality were inconsiderable in
themselves. But the small evil, his having been refused a ribbon by
his Sovereign, exciting in him insupportable uneasiness, was in
reality a great evil. Lady Munster had been dead many years: Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Finlay and Lady Frances were the only surviving children.
Engrossed as the earl had been in public affairs, he still paid
particular attention to their education. Though a man of the
world, he was at the utmost pains in selecting those of
distinguished worth, to whom only he committed the care of his
children. Lord Finlay had promising parts; but force of mind
makes a man capable of great vices or great virtues, but
determines him to neither.</p>

<p>Education, discipline, and accidents of life, constitute him either
a profound philosopher, or a great knave. The probity and
disinterestedness of Mr Burt's principles recommended him to
Lord Munster, for a tutor to his son.&mdash;He had been brought up to
the ministry, with an inclination to it, and entered into it with a
fervent desire of being as useful as he could. His education being
all his fortune, he subscribed, and took every step the church
required, before he was sufficiently acquainted with the doctrines
subscribed to;&mdash;their foundation in scripture, and the controversies
which he afterwards found had been raised, and carried on
about them in the christian world: and, after a diligent inquiry, was
dissatisfied with some doctrines established in our articles, liturgy,
&amp;c. and declined accepting a considerable living in Lord
Munster's gift, on which <i>alone</i> he depended for his future
subsistence, and that of an amiable woman, whom he had
espoused upon these expectations.</p>

<p>I heartily wish that all who are disposed for the ministry of the
church, were as careful to satisfy themselves about the lawfulness
of <i>conformity</i>, and that the church of England laid fewer
obstructions in the way of those who are both disposed and
qualified for advancing the interests of religion and virtue; but
dare not engage publicly in her service, for fear of violating the
peace of their minds, and wounding their consciences. In such a
situation what must a clergyman do? must he preach and maintain
doctrines he disapproves of? this would be acting both against his
persuasion, and his solemn promise at his ordination. Shall he
preach or write against them? this he must not do neither, lest he
should be judged guilty of impugning his subscription, and
consequently incur the censures of the church. Shall he then be
quite silent, and neither preach nor write about them at all? but
how will this be consistent, with his other solemn promise, made
likewise at his ordination, <i>to be ready with all faithful diligence, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
banish and drive away all erroneous and strange doctrines</i>&mdash;all
doctrines which he <i>is persuaded</i>, are contrary to God's word? He
must therefore necessarily offend, either against the church, or
against truth, and his own conscience. A sad alternative! when a
man can neither speak, what he thinks to be truth, with <i>safety</i>, nor
be silent without <i>offence</i>. These considerations induced Mr Burt to
refuse a proffered establishment&mdash;by which conduct, he proved
his belief in a <i>future state</i>, more firmly than a great many of them
appear to do, by their immoderate desires of the good things <i>in
this</i>: but his faith was founded, not on the fallacious arguments of
too many of his brethren; but on that adorable conjunction of
unbounded power and goodness, which must certainly someway
recompense so many thousand innocent wretches, created to be so
miserable here. He possessed that virtue in an eminent degree,
which the christians call humility, and which the ancients were
ignorant of.&mdash;But he had real merit, and could easily be modest,
which is almost impossible to those, who have only the affectation
of it. With this respectable man was Lord Finlay placed, at five
years old, when a considerable settlement was made on him, in
compensation for relinquishing other pursuits, with a promise of
its beings continued for life. Lord Munster from time to time
examined his son, and was highly satisfied with the progress he
made; and not a little surprised, to find him no way deficient in
those accomplishments, which, though of less consequence in
themselves, a late noble author has illustrated as being absolutely
necessary, in compleating the character of a fine gentleman. For
these Lord Finlay was indebted to Captain Lewis, father-in-law to
Mr Burt. This old gentleman was of an antient family, and had
retired from the army, disgusted at his situation, having been many
years in a very subaltern station.</p>

<p>The condition of many brave and experienced officers is to be
lamented, who, after having passed through many various dangers
in the service of their country, are subject to the command of boys
and striplings. Whilst stations, which should be the reward of
martial virtues, can be purchased, it is in vain to hope, that our
officers can be animated like those of a neighbouring nation.</p>

<p>Honour alone can support the soldier in a day of battle; without
this invigorating principle, humanity will tremble at the sight of
slaughter, and every danger will be avoided, which necessity does
not impose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Lewis retained that dignity of sentiment, which no
misfortunes could surmount. Our hearts and understandings, are
not subject to the vicissitudes of fortune. We may have a noble
soul though our circumstances be circumscribed, and a superiority
of mind without being of the highest rank. He had been much
among the <i>great world</i>, in the early part of his life, having been
<i>aide-de-camp</i> to Lord S&mdash;&mdash;. Upon his daughter's marriage with
Mr Burt, he resided entirely with him; and though she died of her
first child, he continued with him, and became as fond of lord
Finlay as his grand-daughter, who, after her mother's decease,
became the object of his tenderest affection.</p>

<p>Thus were Lord Finlay and Miss Burt brought up together; and
from the time of her birth never separated until she was nine years
old. At that period she was sent to a convent at Paris, and
returned, after six years absence, highly accomplished; uniting in
herself everything that could charm a heart that was disengaged.</p>

<p>The consequences to Lord Finlay were inevitable, though never
suspected. A student of about eighteen, full of the amours of Ovid,
and the soft odes in Horace, has a heart very susceptible of love.
These sensations were too agreeable to be repulsed; he delivered
himself entirely over to his passion, which absorbed every other
faculty of his soul. The most perfect affection soon subsisted
between these young people: but the dignity of Miss Burt's
manners inspired her lover with such respect as rendered him
silent on the subject of his passion, as he could not enforce it
without his father's sanction.</p>

<p>But there is an intelligence between tender souls, and the most
animated expression may be conveyed without the aid of words;
and this dumb language is so eloquent, that it is generally
understood where the heart is in unison. Friendship, indeed, was
only spoke of; but their every look, their every action, bespoke the
most ardent love. 'What transports,' (said he, one day to her) 'can
friendship bestow! what refined feelings, what delightful sensations,
actuate the human soul in such happy moments as these!'</p>

<p>We contemplate each other in silence; but the soul is never
more eloquent than under the influence of such a silence. She
expresses, in a moment, a train of ideas and sensations, which
would be but confounded by utterance.</p>

<p>Miss Burt had a merit the more engaging, from its avoiding
notice and parade: a refined genius, enriched with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
knowledge and happy expression, united with the most candid
sincerity and goodness of heart; these qualities entitled her to the
esteem and friendship of every noble mind: and the thick veil,
under which her too great modesty concealed her pre-eminence,
exalted her in the penetrating eyes of her lover. She scarce ever
laid <i>this veil</i> aside, except to him, whose approbation rendered her
indifferent with respect to the commendations of every one else.
He became every day more attached to her: and was so ignorant of
the world as to expect his father's approbation of his passion, and
that he would be propitious to it.</p>

<p>Thus situated were the lovers, when Lord Munster disgusted
with the court retired to the country. He immediately sent for Mr
Burt and Lord Finlay: although the distance was only a few miles,
it was very grievous for the latter to leave a place where he had
access every minute of the day to behold the object of his wishes.</p>

<p>Upon this occasion he was determined to disclose to her the
situation of his heart. He threw himself at her feet, in that pathetic
disorder of spirits which constitutes the true eloquence of love,
and endeavoured to speak, but hesitated at every word. In the
mean time she saw and pitied his confusion.</p>

<p>'I can read,' said she, 'my lord,' with an air of frankness, 'the
sentiments of your heart: I am not insensible of your passion; but
why hath fortune placed us at so great a distance from each other?
how delightful it would have been to me, if&mdash;But,<a name="Corr1"></a>' said she,
(stopping short in her discourse) 'let us not flatter ourselves with
chimeras.&mdash;Let us suppress the emotions of our hearts; it may be
dangerous to indulge them.'</p>

<p>'How? dangerous!' replied Lord Finlay, 'why suppress them? do
not those emotions constitute our happiness? It is the duty of love
to repair the injustice of fortune. How enraptured should I be to
make happy the object I love. Prejudice might object to it perhaps:
but that shall never enslave my understanding, especially as it must
be founded only in pride.'</p>

<p>With these sentiments they parted. It may be easily conceived
how impatient Lord Finlay was to see the idol of his heart, but he
could not with propriety propose quitting his father, for the first
days after his arrival in the country. He at last fell upon the
expedient of suggesting, whether, as he was under such obligations
to Captain Lewis, it would not be proper to call, and invite him to
Munster house. This Lord Munster agreeing to, he and his son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
called one morning; when Miss Burt entertaining them with a little
music, the light-winged god took one of the sharpest arrows from
the fair-one's quiver, applied it to his bow, and swift as the forked
lightning of Jove, fixed it in the old man's heart. Lord Munster
became desperately in love, and determined to make her his wife.
It is not at all surprising that a young woman makes an impression
on an old man. While we have life we have our passions; age
<i>represses</i>, but does not <i>extinguish</i> them. As in maturer years, the fire
lurks under the ashes of prudence; so, if that be wanting, love
burns up and blazes fiercely; and is generally inextinguishable, if it
takes hold of the dry and worm-eaten wood of old-age. Persons of
languid passions (it has been observed) have few partialities; they
neither love, nor hate, nor look, nor move, with the energy of a
man of sense. People of real genius, and strong passions, have
great partialities. The blamelessness of the former should be
weighed with their insignificancy; and the faults of the latter
balanced with their superiority.</p>

<p>Lord Munster made proposals to Mr Burt that very day, never
doubting but that Hymen would soon rekindle his <i>torch</i>.&mdash;But the
same principles determined him respecting his daughter, which
had influenced him in his own affairs. He thanked Lord Munster
for the honor he intended him, which he should acquaint her
of&mdash;but that in an affair in which her happiness for life was so
immediately concerned, he must forgive his interfering further.
When he acquainted her with it; instead of enforcing the
acceptance of the honor proposed to her, he was at great pains to
precaution her, against many disagreeable consequences of such
an unequal alliance, both in age and condition, lest she should be
dazzled by wealth or titles, to sacrifice her inclinations!</p>

<p>Miss Burt, with unfeigned concern, was greatly chagrined to
hear of Lord Munster's proposals: she, therefore, with great
warmth, declared herself totally unfit, for such an exalted station.
'I can neither,' said she, 'adopt the virtues, or the vices of the
great: the former are too conspicuous, the other too obscure. A
round of peaceable employments, proper to satisfy the mind, and
to soothe the heart, is the kind of happiness for which I find
myself inclined.'</p>

<p>'With such principles and inclinations, I could not be happy in
the great world, where the general way of life is solely calculated,
to flatter the senses, and where a superior genius is contemned, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
at least only permitted to exhibit itself in lively sallies, or smart
repartees.'</p>

<p>Mr Burt informed the earl of his daughter's sentiments. But his
lordship's self-love prevailed so far as to render it impossible to
conceive that <i>he could be refused</i>. He, therefore, made preparations
for his nuptials, and sent for his daughter home to be present on
that occasion. Lord Munster had taken the same pains on Lady
Frances's education, as her brother's. Mrs Norden, a distant
relation, had the entire charge of her. She resided in London until
Lady Frances was fourteen years old: at that time she accompanied
her to Rome, where she had the best masters, and where
Santerello improved her taste in music. After remaining three
years at Rome, they went to Paris, from which they were just
returned at the period above mentioned. Lord Munster was
greatly charmed, both with the personal, and acquired perfections
of his daughter: and professed himself much indebted to Mrs
Norden, for the very great attention she had paid to her.</p>

<p>The day after Lady Frances's arrival, she went to Mr Burt's to
pay her respects to her intended mother-in-law.</p>

<p>No servant happening to be in the way to announce her, she
walked forwards into a room, the door of which she saw open,
with an intention to ring the bell, when she found Miss Burt in her
father's library, weeping bitterly: never before had she seen such
an air of languid softness, mixed with so much beauty. What an
affecting sight! She was going to retire, to save her from that
confusion which a sensible heart is apt to feel at having its
afflictions perceived by a stranger; but the lovely mourner,
observing her, endeavoured to suppress her emotions: but her
grief was too violent to be checked; and her tears burst forth the
more, for having been an instant subdued. She could only say,
'That she could be no stranger to <i>who</i> did her the honour of
waiting on her, from the likeness Lady Frances had to her
brother.' The thoughts of Lord Finlay then renewed her affliction;
and asking pardon for her rudeness, she again shed a torrent of
tears. Lady Frances answered, 'That apologies were only due on
her part, for breaking in upon her retirement, and witnessing
emotions she might have wished to conceal.' After a few general
things, she told her the pleasure it gave her of having so near a
prospect of being entitled to take an interest in all her concerns;
when she would be happy in her friendship. In this Lady Frances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
was perfectly sincere; for though she had been alarmed at the
intended marriage taking place, and although she was of a very shy
disposition, yet, at first sight, feeling the greatest partiality for Miss
Burt, she echoed her sighs, and her eyes bore testimony of the
feelings of her heart. With all the confidence of an ancient
friendship, she conjured her to acquaint her with the cause of her
sorrows; and took upon her to console, soothe, and comfort her.
Miss Burt had only time to express the sense she entertained of
her goodness, and to add, her miseries were <i>too great</i> to be
<i>alleviated</i>; when her grand-father entering the room, the conversation
turned upon general topics.</p>

<p>Upon Lady Frances's return home, her father gayly enquired,
What she thought of his intended bride? She answered, Every thing
that was charming; and that she had prepared for her an eternal
habitation in the warmest part of her heart: 'There is every thing
in her,' added she, 'that can engage the affections, or command
the respect, of people of taste and judgment.'</p>

<p>Lord Finlay mean while was under the greatest oppression of
spirits. A thousand conflicting passions tortured his (until then)
undisturbed bosom. Love and filial piety alternatively took
possession of his soul. Each in their turn was rejected.&mdash;When
sentiments are nearly of equal force, the soul, as if unsettled, and
wavering between contrary emotions, knows not which to resolve
on; its decrees destroy each other; scarce is it freed from its
troubles when it is involved in them anew; this undetermined state
does not always terminate to the advantage of the most powerful
sentiment.</p>

<p>After a long conflict, the soul wearied out with the efforts it has
made, gradually loses its sensibility and force together; and finally
yields to the last impression, which thus remains master of the
field. After many struggles, Lord Finlay was determined to
sacrifice his <i>inclinations</i>, or in other words, (what he thought, his
life, to his father.)</p>

<p>This pious resolution, no doubt, was strengthened by his
supposing Miss Burt had acquiesced to the proposed marriage.
His resentment supported his prudence. Such was the situation of
Lord Finlay's mind, when Lady Frances received the following
letter from Miss Burt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Madam,</p>

<p>You found me in tears, and kindly insinuated your desire to
mitigate my distress; receive from me all the acknowledgments
which can proceed from a full heart, raised from the
lowest distress, to a glimmering prospect of avoiding misery,
while that superior Power which witnesses your generosity,
will <i>reward it</i>. Thus, when unhappy, we grasp at the least
shadow of relief! we seize upon it with eagerness, and in a
moment raise ourselves above our afflictions. When an
unhappy drowning wretch is carried away by the current,
while intimidated by the steepness of the banks, and the
rapidity of the torrent, he looks upon death as inevitable; his
sinews relax, his heart fails him, he looks forward to an awful
dreaded futurity: but if the least twig presents its friendly
assistance, his courage at last revives, he raises his head, he
seizes upon it with a hasty avidity, and makes a sudden and
violent effort to save himself from destruction. Such is my
application to your ladyship. Heaven grant you may avert
from me those evils I so much dread! even the horror of
involving my respectable parents <i>in want and misery</i>. My
father's probity has entailed on him poverty; and my
grandfather's half-pay is our sole dependance, exclusive of
the salary Lord Munster settled on my respectable parent
when he undertook to superintend the education of his son;
and which he promised to continue for life, in compensation
for his giving up <i>all other pursuits</i>. I flatter myself, the
frowardness of his unhappy daughter will not frustrate his
lordship's beneficence, and which he judged his labours
entitled him to. May I intreat your ladyship will soften,
through the medium of your influence, the refusal of the
honor intended me!</p>

<p><i>An attempt to deceive would wring my soul to torture</i>: Can I
then take upon me vows at the altar, incompatible with the
feelings of my heart, and the possibility of conforming myself
to? forbid it, gratitude, truth, and justice! let me sooner
become a martyr to these, as my unfortunate father. In every
event of my life, integrity and honor shall influence me. If my
refusal is not founded upon the most <i>advantageous</i>, yet it is
upon the most <i>worthy</i> terms: if that of embracing <i>tranquility</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
before <i>profit</i>, and preferring probity of mind, even attended
with the greatest inconveniences, before its opposite, although
surrounded with every outward accommodation, be deserving
of that epithet. I ask pardon for this intrusion, and have the
honor to be</p>

<p>
<span class="indent-4">Your Ladyship's</span><br />
<span class="indent-6">Obliged humble servant,</span><br />
<span class="smcap indent-8">Mary Ann Burt</span>.'<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The little tenderness Lord Munster had ever shewn Lady
Frances, the impressions she entertained of the sourness of his
disposition, and the severity of his temper; all conspired to fill her
with the greatest awe and dread of his displeasure. It may then be
easily judged how badly qualified she was for the office enjoined
her in the letter. To add to her distress, her valuable friend Mrs
Norden was absent, and she dared not conceal the receipt of it
until her return, as it was a subject that admitted of no delay.</p>

<p>She accordingly summoned up sufficient courage to take the
letter in her hand, and to present herself before her father; when
her timidity and confusion were sufficient vouchers of her
unwillingness to be an agent in such a disagreeable business. Her
apprehensions were considerably increased, when the earl asked
her, in a harsh tone, <i>her business with him</i>? Being unable to reply,
and trembling from head to foot, she gave him the letter&mdash;which
he eagerly pursued, while he was alternately agitated with
indignation, pride, and confusion! He at length broke into a great
rage, loading Lady Frances with invectives, for having innocently
produced these emotions, adding, that he then discovered the
cause of her partiality for Miss Burt: but that if she, or Lord
Finlay, ever presumed, from that time forward, to hold any
communication with <i>the Burt family</i>, he should consider them as
aliens <i>to his</i>! Where friendship is reversed, and turned to enmity,
the <i>latter</i> is generally as <i>extreme</i>, as the <i>former</i> was <i>fervent</i>. If we
were more regular in <i>our affections</i>, we should be more moderate in
<i>our aversions</i>, and, without consulting our interest, should hate
nothing but what is really odious: but we are so unjust, that we
judge only of things by their relation to us; we approve of them
when agreeable to us, and, by a strange infatuation, do not esteem
them as good or bad, but by the satisfaction of disgust they give
us: we would have them alter their quality according to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
caprices, and cameleon like, assume our colours, and accommodate
themselves to our desires. We fain would be the center of
the world, and have all creatures join with us in inclination. Lord
Munster was not only disappointed in his affections, but piqued in
pride, that, after he had by his intrigues led some of the first
princes in Europe, and made them subservient to his views, a little
obscure girl should render him the laughing-stock of the country.
Lady Frances retired, not daring to return him any answer.</p>

<p>Lord Finlay met her, and, alarmed at her appearance, followed
her into her apartment, intreating to know the subject of the letters
she had received from Miss Burt! She informed him of it, and the
disagreeable task she had just executed; when his looks very soon
(to one of her penetration) betrayed the situation of his heart. He
owned to Lady Frances that his life depended on Miss Burt, their
mutual affection, and the violence he had done his inclinations, by
the obligations he had imposed on himself to subdue his passion
whilst it interfered with his father: but remarked with joy, that he
was now relieved from such a painful effort. 'The Almighty,' said
he, 'my dear sister,' (for he was in a state of mind which both
inclined him to be wise and kind) 'implanted both reason and the
passions in human nature, mutually to conduce to <a name="Corr1a"></a>men's happiness.
But, in order to become a happy creature, man is not blindly to
follow the impulses of his passion to the exclusion of reason: nor is
he to contradict his natural desires but when they invert the order
of nature, and oppose the common good of society, the dictates of
right reason, and the manifest design of Providence.&mdash;I have done
what man could do,' added he; 'I did not <a name="Corr2"></a>interfere when my
father was concerned; but I will not relinquish the object of my
affections to any other man breathing.' This was Lord Finlay's
philosophy, which he strictly adhered to&mdash;Tremblingly alive to his
interest, Lady Frances told him the risque he would run of his
father's displeasure; but the impetuosity of his passion rendered
him deaf to her remonstrances; and, regardless of everything but
its gratification, he sat down and wrote the following letter to Miss
Burt.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Madam,</p>

<p>The strict injunctions of my father, that all communication
should cease between our families, renders it necessary for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
me to <i>write</i>, instead of <i>waiting</i> on you in person. Alas, how
poor a substitute is the former for the latter! To express my
sorrow, or paint my grief, is impossible! Were you to know
my distress, you would be sensible of my sufferings, and
compassionate my wretchedness! To be debarred from the
presence of your respectable parents, to whom I have a
thousand obligations, and for whom I feel the greatest respect
and <a name="Corr3"></a>tenderest regard, is a very great hardship: but to be
prevented from beholding you, is downright tyranny, and
forces me to rebel! Could I see Mr Burt, I would intreat him
to pardon, what I am mortified to call the injustice of my
father, and assure him that nothing shall be wanting, on my
part, to soften, and bring him to reason. But I know too well
the inflexibility of his virtue, he will not see me contrary to
the inhibitions I have received.</p>

<p>Permit me on my knees to intreat from you that favor I
dare not request from him! We may meet at&mdash;any day
before seven in the morning. My life depends on your
answer! Let us at least enjoy the soothing pleasure, the
melancholy consolation of mingling griefs, and bearing a part
in each other's sorrows; satisfaction that even renders despair
itself more tolerable! Be persuaded there is nothing, not even
my father, that can divert my eye, my heart, or hand, from an
opportunity of expressing how much I am, with the greatest
respect,</p>

<p>
<span class="indent-4">Your devoted</span><br />
<span class="indent-6">Humble servant,</span><br />
<span class="indent-8"><span class="smcap-all">FINLAY</span></span>'<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>After dispatching the above letter, Lord Finlay spent his time,
fluctuating every moment between hope and despair, agitated with
all the pains of a solicitous suspence; but Miss Burt was too much
attached to him not to agree to his proposal, nor did her
condescension at all infringe on her delicacy.&mdash;She could not
suppose that the good qualities so distinguishable in her lover, and
which had been so studiously cultivated by <i>her father</i>, could be <i>only</i>
violated to the dishonor of <i>his daughter</i>. Lord Finlay's passion was
too ardent to submit to prudence, and could not be long
concealed: they met often, and remained long together; time is
easily forgot in the society of those we love&mdash;In Cupid's dial, <i>hours</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
are but <i>minutes</i>.&mdash;Their interviews were discovered.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis being informed of it, jealous of his honor,
insisted on Lord Finlay's instantly espousing his grand-daughter;
who, loaded with his reproaches, led away by his passion, and the
fears of being interdicted from steering her more&mdash;forgot every
thing but the justification of his honorable intentions.</p>

<p>The indignation with which Lord Munster was seized when
informed of this marriage, is easier to be conceived than
delineated. He swore he would never see his son more, or
contribute to his support!</p>

<p>The passions are more easily excited in the young than in the
old; in women, as being of a frame more delicate than in men; in
the poor and distressed, than in the rich and fortunate, for
prosperity hardens the heart; in the illiterate than in the learned,
because more prone to admire; and for the same reason in those
who have lived privately, than in men of large experience; but
when once fixed, are not so easily eradicated as in the others.</p>

<p>The indiscreet solicitations of a gentleman in the neighbourhood,
served only to exasperate him <i>the more</i>. A weak friend, if he
will be kind, ought to go no further than wishes: if he either says
or does more, it is <i>dangerous</i>. Good intentions are indispensable to
constitute a good man; but other adjuncts are necessary to form
the man who interferes in our behalf. An excellent cause has often
suffered through an indifferent advocate; and I once heard of a
lawyer retained by his client, to <i>hold his peace for him</i>.</p>

<p>In consequence of Lord Munster's implacability, Lord and
Lady Finlay were involved in a variety of wretchedness, and most
affecting distress; under all which they bore up with becoming
fortitude, and never departed from that dignity of behaviour,
which innate virtue, and conscious innocence inspire; strengthened
by true principles of religion, and a rational trust in
providence, tempered with genuine humility, and unfeigned
resignation to whatever fate should be alloted them. In every
action of their lives they had a view to each other: if they were
serious, or cheerful, amused or grieved, still by their sympathy and
love, every trifle made a pleasure, and every pleasure was
heightened into rapture, by their mutual participation of it. Their
hearts exulted with that joy which is built on the strong foundation
of undissembled tenderness. Happy it is for mortals, that grief is
only an exotic in the human breast&mdash;the soil does not naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
afford nutriment for its constant growth. A perfect similarity of
sentiment soon produced that mutual happiness which arises from
loving another better than one's self: they were no longer anxious
for events they could not direct, nor tasted pain from the
disappointment of their hopes.</p>

<p>The half-pay of Captain Lewis, was the only ostensible support
of his unfortunate family, increased by the birth of several
children: but their income had been enlarged, by Mr Burt's
literary productions. His greatest enjoyment was in study&mdash;pleasures
vary with each different age; for God and nature never made
any faculty, either in soul or body, but he prepared a suitable
object in order to its regular gratification.</p>

<p>The follies of men of a certain age, on this account, have the
pre-eminence to all others, a ridiculous dignity, that gives them a
right <i>to be laughed at in the first place</i>. The phenomenon of feeling
amorous pursuits under grey hairs, may as much astonish us, as to
see those mountains whose top is covered with snow, and whose
bowels abound with flames. Mr Burt had a happy temper, formed
on the principles of Christian philosophy. Such was his cheerfulness,
that none of the accidents of life could discompose him; such
his fortitude, that not even the severest trials could unman him.
He had a collected spirit, and on no occasion wanted a resource.
He could retire within himself, and hold the world at defiance.</p>

<p><a name="Arcadia"></a>His amiable daughter possessed also these qualities in an
eminent degree. Captain Lewis dying, their circumstances were
reduced; but Lady Finlay, by her ingenuity supplied the loss they
sustained in his half-pay. She had a fine genius for painting, and
in that art did wonders. By the sale only of a <i>Crucifixion</i>, and an
<i>Arcadia</i>, she maintained her family for two years. She concealed
her name, lest she should irritate Lord Munster more against her;
but had too much good sense to be ashamed of employing those
talents, bestowed on her by nature for <i>so natural a purpose</i>. And the
hours that the <i>indolent</i> devote <i>to rest</i>, and the licentious to <i>pleasure</i>,
she dedicate to providing bread for her family. Good blood cannot
be kept up, without the shambles of the market, so it is no scandal
to procure <i>that</i> by ingenuity or industry, when the appendages of
gentility are so far reduced as not to afford it otherwise.</p>

<p>The picture called Arcadia, is in the possession of the Marquis
of P&mdash;&mdash;. In it there is exhibited a view of the most delightful
region, with the grandest rural scenery in the world; and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
romantic wildness runs through the whole, which gives uncommon
beauties to the piece. Her happy fancy, and the prospects in the
country (they had retired to Wales for cheapness) supplied her
with vales more charming than those of <i>Juan Fernandez</i>, with lawns
like those of <i>Tinian</i>, and finer water-falls than those of <i>Quibo</i>. She
copied the greatest beauties in nature, and formed the finest
imitations. The invention of the whole is extremely pleasing; and
has been applauded by all who have seen it, as a master piece in
the landscape way.</p>

<p>Lady Finlay's health decreasing she could no longer <i>exert this
talent</i>; and the miserable situation to which her Lord was reduced,
in consequence of his attachment to her, afforded her constant
uneasiness. The griping hand of poverty, produced painful fears,
and corroding cares, while the anxiety of mind <i>each</i> suffered for <i>the
other</i>, increased their <i>mutual calamity</i>.</p>

<p>The death of two fine children at last entirely subdued Lady
Finlay's remaining spirits&mdash;She died in child-bed, (the infant
surviving her a few hours) leaving behind her only two children. It
was then Lord Finlay's cup of affliction was filled. He had reason
to fear, the deceased, dearest object of his tenderest affections,
had perished for want of proper assistance. <i>Assistance!</i> their scanty
circumstances denied! If previous to this, when he perceived in
her any marks of sorrow, it was to him as if all nature had been
eclipsed; what must have been his sensations <i>then</i>? they were too
great for humanity to support! His reason forsook him; and the
third day after her decease, he expired in the delirium of madness.</p>

<p>Nothing can give a better sense of the consideration man ought
to have of his latter end, than the following lines of Sir Thomas
More:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'You'd weep, if sure you'd but one month to stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet laugh, uncertain of a single day!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Few are the happy marriages contracted contrary to the consent
of parents.&mdash;Disobedience to them, like murder, seldom goes
unpunished in this life<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. Mr Burt wrote Lady Frances Finlay a
letter informing her of the <a name="Corr4"></a>melancholy catastrophe of this
unfortunate couple, and beseeching her interest with Lord
Munster, in behalf of their helpless progeny.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>'Could tears, Madam,' said he, 'write as legibly as ink, my
streaming eyes would be an inexhaustible fund, to assist me to
send you the woes of a poor old man, and to pour forth the
sorrows of my soul! But <i>Cicero</i> could not have <i>described</i>, <i>Apelles</i>
could not have <i>painted</i>, nor <i>Roscius</i> have <i>represented</i>, the heartrending
scenes I have lately witnessed.'</p>

<p>Lord Munster died the day before his daughter received the
above letter. He had for some time before lost all sensation. The
pleasures or pains of others were to him of so little importance,
that he lived as if he had been the only creature himself in the
universe. He could not bear to hear of the applause some of his
opponents in politics had acquired, and grudged them a reputation
he thought only suitable to his own distinguished abilities.
Different from that conqueror, of whom it is said he silenced the
whole earth, he fancied that the whole world must talk of his
disgrace. He could not support it; and a pistol put an end to his
wretched existence. A careful observer of events will frequently
see, that flagrant vices are punished by some remarkable strokes of
wretchedness, and bad dispositions made sensible of the evils they
bring on others. Never did any Greek or Roman commit suicide,
from too quick a sense of private misfortunes.&mdash;Vain glory in the
vulgar may be supportable, nay, may be diverting; but in a great
man it is <i>intolerable</i>: nothing is greater in a man, than to be above
even greatness <i>itself</i>.</p>

<p>Lady Frances was left by her father the entire possession of the
family estate.&mdash;She immediately wrote to Mr Burt, desiring he
would leave a place which must necessarily revive in him such
melancholy ideas, and bring her nephew and niece to Munster
house; enclosing him a sum of money to discharge debts, and to
defray the expenses of the journey. He instantly complied with her
request, and resided with her, though she immediately not only
settled on him the annuity he had formerly been promised, but
also paid the arrears due on it.</p>

<p>Had Lord and Lady Finlay lived a few weeks longer, Lady
Frances would have cheerfully assigned to them the estate
bequeathed to her, and which their virtues so justly entitled them
to.</p>

<p>It is a strong argument for a state of retribution hereafter, that
in this world <i>virtuous people</i> are often <i>very miserable</i>, and <i>vicious ones
happy</i>, which is wholly repugnant to the nature of a Being, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
appears infinitely wise and good in all his works, unless we may
suppose, that such a promiscuous and undistinguishing distribution
of good and evil, which was necessary for carrying on the
designs of Providence in this life, will be rectified and made
amends for in another.</p>

<p>Lady Frances possessed the most attractive beauty, was
surrounded with every grace, and blessed with every virtue, that
could enslave the affections, and captivate the soul of the most
stubborn philosophers. The sound of her voice had an engaging
sweetness; and her expressions were well chose, without being
affected.&mdash;In a word, it was her character and mind that gave
charms to her person. Lord Darnley made his addresses to her, in
which he had been countenanced by Lord Munster, and every
preparation was making for their nuptials, before her father's
death.</p>

<p>Lord Darnley was one of the most amiable of men. He gave a
grace to every thing he said&mdash;a refined and delicate wit enlivened
all his discourse, and the vivacity of his imagination discovered
itself continually in fresh sallies. But what irresistibly fixed Lord
Munster's partiality; was the art with which he disguised his <i>own
wit</i> and <i>knowledge</i> to make <i>him shine</i>. He conformed entirely to that
pleasing criterion of true humour which Mr Addison gave,&mdash;'That
it looks grave itself, while it makes all others laugh.' He had a turn
for placing things in a ridiculous point of view, which was highly
diverting&mdash;but by this he never offended; he formed his ridicule
on a circumstance, which the party attacked, was not in his heart
unwilling to grant him; that he was guilty of an excess in
something which in itself was laudable<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. He very well understood
what he chose to be, what was his predominant passion, and knew
he need not fear his anger, for declaring he was a little <i>too much the
thing</i>.</p>

<p>Nice raillery is a decent mixture of praise and reproach; it
touches slightly upon little failings, only to dwell the more upon
great qualities. I believe what renders courtiers pleasing, is the
attention they pay to the self-love of others. I shall only add, that
the politeness of Lord Darnley's manners would not suffer him to
omit any of those engaging attentions which are so capable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
pleasing; and as he was deeply in love with Lady Frances, he
inspired her with mutual sentiments. How then must it surprise
the world to find, that upon her sudden acquisition of wealth, the
marriage did not take place! The philosopher, experienced in the
vicissitudes of human events, views such sudden dissolutions of
the most intimate connections without surprise or amazement. In
regard to the moral and political world, it is not always great and
adequate causes that produce strange and surprising events; on
the contrary, they often are the result of things seemingly small,
and utterly disproportionate to their effects. The same constant
fluctuation that attends the seasons, and all the appendages of the
globe we inhabit, affects the heart of man, making it a prey, by
turns, to different passions. The well-regulated mind alone, can
boast of any degree of consistency, and <i>that</i> too often late in life,
the product of long experience, and unnumbered cares. It was in
vain Lord Darnley declared the disinterestedness of his passion,
and intreated Lady Frances to settle the property of the family out
of his power, previous to her marriage.</p>

<p>She remained unmoved; only assured him, that nothing but
what she apprehended was her first duty, could alienate her from
him, and that she never would dispose of herself to any <i>other</i>: but
advised him to marry. She applied herself entirely to the care of
her family, and to the improvement of that property invested in
her person.</p>

<p>Living entirely in the country, she sought, in the beauty of
nature, in science, and the love of order, that satisfaction, which in
the world (where people are the <i>slaves of apology, and the dupes of
caprice</i>) is eagerly pursued, but <i>never found</i>. It is principally on this
account, that people in general are so often declaiming against
human life. She considered society is manifestly maintained by a
circulation of kindness: we are all of us, in some way or other,
wanting assistance, and in like manner qualified to give it. None
are in a state of independency on their fellow-creatures. The most
slenderly endowed are not a mere burthen on the community; even
they can contribute their share to the common good. We learn
what are justly our mutual claims, from this mutual dependency;
that on its account, as well as for other reasons, our life is not to
pass in a round of pleasure of idleness, or according to the
suggestions of mere fancy, or in sordid or selfish pursuits. Can
there be any thing more evidently our duty than that we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
return the kindness we receive; than that, if many are employed in
promoting our interest, we should be as intent in advancing theirs?
All men are by nature equal: their common passions and
affections, their common infirmities, their common wants, give
such constant remembrances of this equality, even to those who
are most disposed to forget it, that they cannot, with all their
endeavours, render themselves unmindful of it. They cannot
become <i>insensible</i>, how unwilling soever they may be to <i>consider</i>,
that their debt is as much their demands, as they owe to others as
much as they reasonably can expect from them. It is not to be
supposed that Providence would have made such distinctions
among men, such unequal distributions, but that they might
endear themselves to one another by mutual helps and obligations.
Gratitude is the surest bond of love, friendship, and society.</p>

<p>The various conditions of human life seem so admirably
adapted to the several dispositions of individuals, that if our
happiness in this life were intended, the unequal distribution of
the gifts of fortune affords the most plausible means to effect it.
Through nature, indeed, love is centered at home, and not
improperly, though the most amiable and God-like is the most
diverged. But as the principle regards of human love, are, for the
much greater part, over selfish and contracted, the divine
goodness has so directed its operations, as to render them
necessary, and very often unintentionally productive of common
social good. I have often observed, that people favoured by fortune
seldom feel for the pain of the mind, even though they themselves
are the authors of it; their pity alone is excited by certain
disgraces, certain exterior evils, such as sickness and poverty. This
was by no means the case with Lady Frances, who interested
herself in the distresses of the soul, with a goodness equally noble
and judicious, and offered to the unhappy, all those labouring
under any species of innocent distress, consolation and relief.</p>

<p>Her education taught her, that <i>virtue</i> and <i>abilities</i> can only
procure us real happiness, and that nothing but <i>doing good</i>, in that
sphere of life in which we are placed, can afford the true felicity to
a noble soul. Upon her father's death she found herself possessed
of an estate of twenty thousand pounds a year, and three hundred
thousand pounds in mortgages. The house and pleasure grounds
were in great disrepair, from the late Earl's constant residence in
London and the <i>environs</i>. Lady Frances sent for Mr Brown, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
found great <i>capabilities</i> in the situation: under his direction it is
now one of the finest places in England. She acquainted him of
her intention of building a number of houses for the reception of
artificers, and the introduction of certain manufactures. He fixed
upon a beautiful situation, at the side of a navigable river. Mr
Adams approved very much of the plan Lady Frances submitted to
his inspection&mdash;he perfected and improved it. It consisted of one
hundred houses; and a <i>tribuna</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in the center. Upon the solid
foundation of the Doric, the Ionic, and Corinthian orders rise
gradually with all their beauty, proportion, and ornaments.</p>

<p>The fabric seizes the most incurious eye. No modern building is
comparable to it for the outward decorations; and for the
disposition within, it has been formed from whatever ancient and
modern times afford most adapted and suitable to the purpose of
the structure, not excluding decorations, which are distributed
with equal taste and economy. The sciences and arts are
assembled together in this fine building, and connected (if I may
be allowed the expression) by a large and well chosen library in all
faculties: Here is whatever the lower people's interest, or the man
of taste's curiosity can desire. The first object that presents itself
to the eye, on entering into this noble hall, which is no less
spacious than splendid, is the statue of the founder, inviting the
lovers of literature to make use of the helps which she has
provided for them. This statue is of white marble, as large as life,
and entirely worthy of Mr More, the artist; who has improved the
exact likeness with an air of grandeur and benevolence, dignity
and affability.</p>

<p>And what is a very well chosen ornament for such a place, there
is a representation of nine of the most eminent libraries&mdash;the
Babylonian, Athenian, Alexandrian, Palatine, etc.&mdash;with short
inscriptions giving an account of each. And to set in view, the
origin and first advance of learning in several countries&mdash;there are
painted on large pilasters ranged along the middle of the library,
those persons who were reputed to have been the inventor of
letters in several languages. Adam, Abraham, Moses, Mercurius,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Ægyptius, Hercules, Cadmus, Cecrops, Pythagoras, and several
others, with the letters which each of these are said to have
invented written under their pictures.</p>

<p>This library is open at stated times, (like that of the Vatican, and
the French king's) with every proper accommodation to all
strangers. This was greatly wanted in this kingdom. London, after
so many ages, remains without any considerable public library.
The best is the Royal Society's: but even that is inconsiderable;
neither is it open to the public; nor are the necessary conveniences
afforded strangers for reading or transcribing. The British
Museum is rich in manuscripts, the Harleian Collection, the
Cottonian Library, the collection of Charles I. and many others,
especially on our own history; but it is wretchedly poor in printed
books: and it is not sufficiently accessible to the public; their
revenue not being sufficient to enable them to pay a proper
number of attendants.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
</p>

<p>An ingenious Persian lately in England, gave an account of
many thousand Arabian manuscripts, totally unknown to the
gentlemen of the university of Oxford. It is to be wished these
were procured. The Orientals and Hebrews were the parents of
knowledge, and the Greeks no more than their scholars: how gross
were their notions of prudence and <i>virtue</i>, till Orpheus, and the
travelled philosophers taught them better! The institutions of
modern nations are not to be compared to those of the ancients, as
almost all these had the advantage of being founded by
philosophers. Athens and Sparta were the two first formed states
of Greece. Solon and Lycurgus, who had seen the success of the
plan conducted by Minos in Crete, and who partly copied after
that wise prince, erected these two celebrated republics. The
sagacious system of Egypt served as a model to all the east.</p>

<p>The astronomical observatory is furnished with the best
instruments; anatomy has an amphitheatre, and a spacious room
filled with a compleat set of anatomical pieces in wax.</p>

<p>Painting and sculpture, besides a most convenient apartment for
the study and practice of these arts, have two large rooms full of
models of the most valuable remains of antiquity, taken from the
originals.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>The pupils of architecture have a hall, crowded with designs
and models of the finest pieces, ancient and modern&mdash;and there
are contiguous apartments where all the liberal sciences are read
and taught, as logic, physic, ethics, metaphysics, astronomy,
geography, geometry, etc.</p>

<p>These assemblage of studies in every branch is further enriched
with curious museums of antiques, and natural history. All these
advantages are heightened by the lectures of able professors in
every art and every science.</p>

<p>This academy receives two hundred scholars, affords them a
liberal support, and leads them through a perfect course of
education; from the first elements of letters, through the whole
circle of the sciences; from the lowest class of grammatical
learning, to the highest degrees in the several faculties. It properly
and naturally consists of two parts, rightly forming two <a name="Corr5"></a>establishments,
the one subordinate to the other. The design of the one
was to lay the foundation of science; that of other, to raise and
compleat the superstructure: the former was to supply the latter
with proper subjects; and the latter was to improve the advantages
received in the former.</p>

<p>The young gentlemen in the neighbourhood are permitted to
receive instructions from the several professors&mdash;and a day is set
apart, when they examine young people, in order to discover
wherein their genius conflicts, and to what kind of studies or
employments they naturally are suited. Every man finds in himself
a particular bent and disposition to some particular character; and
his struggling against it is the fruitless and endless labour of
Sisyphus. Let him follow and cultivate <i>that</i> vocation, he will
succeed in it, and be considerable in one way at least; whereas, if
he departs from it, he will at best be <i>inconsiderable</i>, probably
<i>ridiculous</i>. Cicero said, that masters should consider the nature of
their scholars, least they should act like unskilful husbandmen,
who would sow wheat in a soil, that was only proper for oats.
Might it not prove an useful institution if public societies were
erected on this plan? By this means most subjects might become
beneficial to the public; and not only the arts be brought to
perfection, but all the posts of government be well supplied:
whereas, we now daily hear complaints of the want of proper
persons to direct affairs, whilst the youth are condemned to
studies, and matriculated into certain arts or employments before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
they arrive at years of discretion.</p>

<p>Some parents on the birth of a son determine what profession
he is to be of. The father sometimes designs his son for a judge,
because his grand-father was one<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, which may be as absurd as to
design a <i>weakly child</i> for a <i>running footman</i>, or a <i>purblind boy</i> for a
<i>painter</i>. Sometimes a young man is to be a colonel because he is
tall, or an alderman because he has a large belly.</p>

<p>When any remarkable genius displayed itself in any of the young
men, their talents have cultivated for that art of science. The
master for oratory was recommended by Mr Sheridan, who says
that the art of oratory may be taught upon as certain principles,
and with as good a prospect of success, as it ever was by the
rhetoricians of Greece or Rome, or as the arts of music, painting,
etc. are taught by their several professors. He formed himself on
Quintilian's institutes of eloquence, who particularly recommends
<i>chironomy</i>, or gracefulness of action, which took rise in the age of
heroism, was practised by the greatest men in Greece, was
approved of by Socrates, ranked by Plato amongst the civil virtues,
and recommended by Chrysippus in his treatise upon the
education of youth. Quintilian had the acquisition of an hundred
years after Cicero's death, to improve his knowledge&mdash;he had
greater opportunities than Cicero ever had to study 'that
intellectual relation, that secret charm, in the liberal professions,
which, connecting one to the other, combines them all.'</p>

<p>One angle of the <i>tribuna</i> is entirely dedicated to the education of
women. Twenty young ladies are admitted, and there are funds for
their perpetual maintenance, as that of the two hundred scholars.
In the selection of these young gentlewomen, she always gives the
preference to those who labour under any imperfection of
body&mdash;endeavouring, by increasing their resources <i>within themselves</i>,
to compensate for their <i>outward defects</i>. When it is found that
any of these ladies have a taste for any manual or mental art, they
cultivate it, and assist them in the pleasantest means, and by
various little attentions confirm these inclinations with all the spirit
of pursuit requisite to preserve minds (in general) from that state
of languidness and inactivity, whereby life is rendered irksome to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
those who have never found it unfortunate. In this establishment
she entirely runs counter to that of Madame de Maintenon's at
Saint Cyr; where the young women, who should have been
instructed in rural labours, and economy in the duties of a family,
in the employments of <i>Solomon's virtuous women</i>, by their
education, were only fit to be addressed by men who were rich
enough to require in a wife nothing <i>but virtue</i>. This is also the
foible of too many parents, who all expect their daughters are to
fill exalted stations in life, and by educating them with that view,
disqualify them for their after lot.</p>

<p>As divines say that some people take more pains to be damned
than it would cost them to be saved, so many people employ more
thought, memory, and application, to be fools, than would serve to
make them wise and useful members of society. The ancients
esteemed it an honor to understand the making of every thing
necessary for life one's self, without any dependence on others;
and it is that which Homer most commonly calls <i>wisdom</i> and
<i>knowledge</i>. He describes old Eumæus making his own shoes, and
says, he had built some fine stalls for the cattle he bred. Ulysses
himself built his own house, and set up his bed with great art, the
structure of which served to make him known to Penelope again.
When he left Calypso, it was he alone that built and rigged the
ship.&mdash;From all which we see the spirit of these ancient times.</p>

<p>These young ladies are not instructed to declaim with grace, or
sing with taste; but if they are less amusing, they are infinitely
more useful and interesting companions to those they afterwards
associate with, whether in the character of wives or friends.
Several of them have married very well in the neighbourhood.
There is no sentiment more cold, or of shorter continuance, than
admiration. We grow weary of a set of features, though ever so
beautiful. Between folly, and a homely person, there is this
difference; the latter is constantly the same, at least with
imperceptible alteration, whilst folly is ever putting on some new
appearance, and giving, by that means, fresh pain and disgust.
However true this may be, I believe it would require some rhetoric
to convince a young man not to prefer the folly that accompanies
beauty, to wisdom and deformity. Though Sir Francis Bacon
assures us in his natural philosophy, that our taste is never better
pleased than with those things which at first created a disgust in
us. He gives particular instances of porter, olives, and other things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
which the palate seldom approves of at first; but when it has once
got a relish of them, generally retains it for life.</p>

<p>The streets, which were built on each side of the <i>Tribuna</i>, were
uniform, and the houses ornamented with emblematical figures of
the different trades intended for the possessors. She permitted
them to live rent-free for the two first years, and admitted none
but such who excelled in their art. This was certainly very
political&mdash;By encouraging them in this manner, it enabled them at
first to work, and sell their manufactures at a moderate rate; which
insured them the business of the neighbouring counties that would
otherwise have sent at a greater distance, for what could be equally
produced at home.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The size of the houses decreases gradually from the centre of
every street. As Lady Frances spared no expense in the execution,
Mr Adams directed it with the greatest taste and propriety. The
smallest houses are, indeed, exteriorly, the handsomest, on
account of their twisted columns; yet, as they convey an idea of
weakness, they always displease when they are made use of as
supports to heavy buildings. The different orders succeed each
other, from the Corinthian to the Tuscan, according to the size of
the houses. Mr Hogarth observes on this head, that the bulks and
proportions of objects are governed by fitness and propriety; that it
is this which has established the size and proportion of chairs,
tables, and all sorts of utensils and furniture; has fixed the
dimensions of pillars, arches, etc. for the support of great weights;
and so regulated all the orders in architecture.</p>

<p>In the course of ten years Lady Frances brought all the above
plans to perfection; which she the more easily effected from Mr
Burt's having maintained a correspondence with the <i>literati</i> in
most parts of the world. And as the encouragement given was
great, it is not surprising that her academy became a seat of the
muses, and a place to which many resorted for the solution of
literary doubts.</p>

<p>If their ears were enchanted by harmony, their eyes were
equally ravished by the beauties of painting and sculpture. In this
charming mansion is blended the improvement of the arts, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
that of philosophy: an exquisite assemblage of all the sweets of life.
Architecture, statuary, painting, and music, find in her a
patroness. Refinement of taste in a nation, is always accompanied
with refinement of manners. People accustomed to behold order
and elegance in public buildings, and public gardens, acquire
urbanity in private. The Italians, on the revival of the liberal arts
and sciences, gave them the name of <i>virtù</i>; from this was derived
the term of <i>virtuoso</i>, which has been accepted throughout Europe.
Should not this appellation intimate, to those who assume it to
themselves, that the study of what is beautiful, in nature or art,
ought to render them more virtuous than other men. Exclusive of
the above buildings, there are others finely adapted to their
different purposes, at the same time calculated to ornament the
grounds. There are manufactories of different kinds; and silks
wrought by hydraulic machines, which renders the workmanship
more easy and expeditious. Lady Frances procured artificers from
Tuscany for a <a name="Corr6"></a>porcelain manufacture, which has continued with
them from the ancient Etruscans. She has also established a
manufacture of earthen ware, procuring models of Etruscan vases
in Terra Cotta, made after those in the Vatican library. These are
used even in the most common vessels. She also took some pains
in regulating the dress of the young women. A country girl
returning from the spring with a pitcher of water on her head,
perfectly resembles those figures which the most exquisite
antiques represent in the same attitude. The great share <i>variety</i>
has in producing beauty, may be seen in the ornamental part of
nature; the shapes and colours of plants, flowers, leaves; the
painting in butterflies wings, shells, etc. which seem of little other
intended use, than that of entertaining the eye with the pleasure of
variety: in this all the senses delight and are equally averse to
sameness&mdash;The ear is as much offended with one continued note,
as the eye is with being fixed to a point, or to the view of a dead
wall.</p>

<p>Every building is rendered ornamental to the grounds. There is
a botanical garden, which is filled with plants and flowers, which
have been presented to Linnæus, from whom she received them,
from every part of the globe. One of his pupils resided here, in an
elegant habitation, in which there is a rotunda where lectures on
botany are given: this fine room is surrounded with exotic plants.
Mr Burt entirely concurred with Linnæus, in wishing, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
gentlemen designed for theological studies were directed to apply
as much time to the study of physics as they spent in metaphysics
and logic, which he judges neither so indispensably necessary, nor
useful as the former.</p>

<p>Lady Frances also erected an hospital for the reception of two
hundred incurables; a thing much wanted in this kingdom, without
paying any regard to their country, religion, or disease, requiring
no security in case of death. The practice of most of the public
hospitals in this country is widely different, the restrictions of
admission being such as frequently deprive many from receiving
the benefit first intended by the founder. But she had a fund of
charity of another stamp, which gave her infinitely more pleasure,
as it was free from the ostentation of those acts of public bounty.
These were private donations to those whose circumstances were
not yet so bad as to oblige them to beg publicly. If an industrious
tradesman had a numerous family, little business, or a small stock,
she found means to supply his wants, or put him in a way of
carrying on his business to greater advantage, in such a manner, as
that sometimes he himself did not know the source of his relief; at
most, none but the party succoured, and Mr Burt, knew any thing
of the matter, for this worthy man was her secret almoner, and
searched out for the secret necessities of modest and industrious
poor. She had the happiness arising from the consciousness of
having maintained numerous families in decent plenty, who,
without her well-timed and secret bounty, must have been a
charge to the parish. But she was a great enemy to poor-rates,
judging with Davenant, that they will be the bane of our
manufactures.</p>

<p>Lady Frances was far from being alarmed at the great expenses
of her undertakings. She thought her large fortune, and her
nephew's long minority, as it put it in her power, could not be
better employed than in works of national magnificence. The
power and wealth of ancient Greece were most seen and admired
in the splendor of the temples, and other sublime structures of
Pericles. He boasted, that every art would be exerted, every hand
employed, every citizen in the pay of the state, and the city, not
only beautified, but maintained by itself. The sums Lady Frances
expended in bringing these plans to perfection, diffused riches and
plenty among the people, and has already doubled the estate. She
has a fine collection of pictures.&mdash;The only way to raise a genius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
for painting, is to give encouragement: historical painters get so
little by their profession, that we have very few. This Lady Frances
made her particular object, to afford our youth ready access to
good pictures: till these be multiplied in Great Britain, we shall
never have the reputation of producing a good painter. If we
expect to rival the Italian, the Flemish, or even the French school,
our artists must have before their eyes the finished works of the
greatest masters. It is a pity, that when an ingenious gentleman<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
last winter submitted to the parliament, as worthy of their
attention, some considerations that might tend to the encouragement
of useful knowledge, and the advancement in this kingdom
of the arts and sciences, he did not with his usual intelligence,
represent the bad consequences of the duty laid on pictures
imported into Great Britain: Were the bad effects of this
represented to our legislature, it is impossible but it must be
amended. This gentleman took notice in his speech, that a
remarkable opportunity of improving the national taste in <i>painting</i>,
which was lately lost, he hoped would now be recovered. The
incomparable Sir Joshua Reynolds, and some other great painters,
who do honor to our country, generously offered to adorn the
cathedral of St Paul's (a glorious monument of the magnificence
of our ancestors) with some of their most valuable works: but the
proposition was rejected by the late Bishop of London<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, though he
flatters himself it will be renewed, and accepted by the gentleman
at present in that fee<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, who is not only a man of <i>solid piety</i>, but of
the <i>soundest learning</i>, and of <a name="Corr7"></a><i>exquisite classical taste</i>. The great art of
human life is not to eradicate the passions, but to adopt the proper
objects of them: if mankind cannot think so abstractedly as a pure
effort of unmixed reason implies, I presume it follows, that some
degree of passion is warrantable in devotion. While we are in our
present imperfect and embodied state, it will be found necessary
to call in <i>externals</i> to our aid, for the proper discharge of religious
worship. Even among those who in their private devotions are
most sincere, external acts and ceremonies, when properly
conducted, become real assistances; because the connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
between the body and soul, between the senses and the
imagination, between the passions and the reason of mankind, is
so strong and mutual, that they uniformly act and re-act upon one
another, and mutually raise the soul to new and higher degrees of
fervor.</p>

<p>This was so much Lady Frances's opinion, that she had some
fine pieces of painting in her chapel, which is also a very fine new
building; the architecture and paintings do honor to the
artists&mdash;She made it a rule to be constant in her attendance at
church. Public acknowledgments of the goodness of God, and
application for his blessings, contribute to give a whole community
suitable apprehensions of him: and these, if it was her duty to
entertain, it was equally her duty to propagate; both as the regard
she paid the divine excellencies was expressed, and as the same
advantage that she received from such apprehensions, was
received by all whom they affected in the same manner.</p>

<p>She had not the smallest degree of superstition, having too
much good sense to imagine the Deity can be persuaded to recede
from the settled laws of the universe, and the immutability of his
nature. But she knows the perfections of God are a ground and
sufficient reason for prayer, and that it is both an act and a means
of virtue.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> She had a mind free from prejudice, adorned with
knowledge, and filled with the best principles; a noble firmness in
showing these principles, and in maintaining them; in short, every
talent joined to the most amiable modesty. She was advised to call
her elegant village by the name of <i>Athens</i>; but this she declined,
naming it <i>Munster Village</i>: but she justly thought it deserved
it; with this difference, that the inhabitants are too well informed
to give into such gross superstitions, and so easily suffer
themselves to be imposed upon by astrologers, divines, soothsayers,
and many other sorts of conjurers, as the Grecians
did.</p>

<p>They excelled in arts; their laws were wise; they had brought
everything to perfection that makes life easy and agreeable: but
they took little pains in the speculative sciences, geometry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
astronomy, and physics. The anatomy of plants and animals, the
knowledge of minerals and meteors, the shape of the earth, the
course of the stars, and the whole system of the world, were still
mysteries to them.</p>

<p>The Chaldeans and Egyptians, who knew something of them,
kept it a great secret and never spoke of them but in riddles; so
that until Alexander's time, and the reign of the Macedonians,
they had made no great progress in such learning as might cure
them of superstition. An immoderate love of the study of astrology,
was a weakness which characterized also the fifteenth century. In
the age of Lewis XIV, the court was infatuated with the notion of
judicial astrology: many of the princes, through a superstitious
pride, supposed that nature, to distinguish them, had writ their
destiny in the stars. Victor Amadeus, Duke of Savoy, father to the
Duchess of Burgundy, had an astrologer always with him, even
after his abdication. The same weakness which gave credit to the
absurd chimera, judicial astrology, also occasioned the belief of
sorcery and witchcraft; courts of justice composed of magistrates,
who ought to have had more sense than the vulgar, were employed
in trying persons accused of witchcraft.&mdash;Latest <a name="Corr8"></a>posterity must
hear with astonishment that the Madame d'Ancre was burnt at the
<i>Gréve</i> as a sorceress. This unfortunate woman, when questioned
by counsellor Courtin concerning the kind of sorcery she had used
to influence the will of Mary de Medecis, having answered, <i>She
had used that power only which great souls always have over weak
minds</i>; this sensible reply served only to precipitate the decree of
her death<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>It must be confessed there is a strong propensity in man's
nature, to assign every thing uncommon to supernatural means.
But though I am very apt to believe there is greater credulity in
most minds, than will be candidly acknowledged, yet the degree of
it must be in proportion to people's ignorance and want of
information. Thus the famous doctors of the faculty at Paris, when
John Faustus brought the first printed books that had then been
seen in the world, or at least seen there, and sold them for
manuscripts, were surprised at the performance, and questioned
Faustus about it; but he affirming they were manuscripts, and that
he kept a great many clerks employed to write them, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
satisfied. Looking further, however, into the work, and observing
such an exact uniformity throughout the whole, that if there was a
blot in one, it was the same in all, etc. etc. etc. their doubts were
revived. The learned divines not being able to comprehend the
thing, (and that was always sufficient) concluded it must be the
<i>devil</i>; that it was done by magic and witchcraft; and that, in short,
poor Faustus (who was indeed nothing but a mere printer) dealt
with the <i>devil</i>.</p>

<p>They accordingly took him up for a <i>magician</i> and a <i>conjurer</i>, and
one that worked by the <i>Black Art</i>, that is to say, by the help of the
devil&mdash;and threatened to hang him; commencing a process against
him in their criminal courts; when the fear of the gallows induced
Faustus to <i>discover the secret</i>&mdash;that he had been a compositor to
Koster of Harlem, the first inventor of printing.</p>

<p>Gardening made a much slower progress among the ancients,
than architecture. The palace of Alcinous, in the seventh book of
the Odyssey, is grand and highly ornamented; but his garden is no
better than what we call a kitchen garden. This also Lady Frances
excelled in. She had also a receptacle for all sorts of animals to
retire to in their old age. It was of old the custom to bury the
favourite dog near the master. To use those of the brute creation
who toil for our pleasure, or labour for our profit, with hard and
ungenerous treatment, is a species of inhumanity which all men
allow to be derogatory from virtue. The authors of wanton cruelty
towards the dumb creation, are justly execrated for their brutality.
It is a crime which I believe many commit, without either
considering the misery it <i>produces</i>, or the guilt <i>it incurs</i>: and many
more, who in fits of causeless or capricious displeasure intend to
inflict the misery, have yet no sense that they incur guilt. Lady
Frances makes use of buffaloes to draw her ploughs. These
animals are far stronger than oxen, and eat less. Why have we not
them in this country, and dromedaries and camels?</p>

<p>She cultivates India corn, which grows with vast reeds, which is
of great use; and has attempted the culture of rice, and some other
things upon boggy ground, with tolerable success. As our cork
used to come from France, and now grows in Italy, she has tried it
here, where it thrives amazingly; it resembles the evergreen oak,
and bears acorns. When you strip other trees of their bark, they
die; but this grows stronger, and produces a new coat. She leaves
nothing unattempted which has a chance of becoming useful. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
also procured sheep from Norway, which are peculiar from having
four horns, and being spotted like deer, with a coat of substance
betwixt the hair and wool, which is admirable for many uses.</p>

<p>Edward IV has been greatly censured, as taking a very impolitic
and injurious measure in making a present to the King of Spain of
some Cotswold sheep; the breed of which has been very
detrimental to the English woollen manufacture, which has been a
national branch of trade ever since. The celebrated Buffon
affirms, that our sheep are very far removed from their natural
state; from which it has been the usual course of things to decline.</p>

<p>Lady Frances cultivates silk-worms. The ancient Romans for a
long time never dreamed that silk could be produced in their
country; and the first silk ever seen in Greece, was after the
conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great. From thence it was
imported into Italy, but was sold at the rate of an equal weight of
gold.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The Persians being the only people of whom it was to be had,
would not permit a single egg or worm to be carried out of their
country. Hence the ancient Greeks and Romans were so little
acquainted with the nature of silk, that they imagined it grew like a
vegetable. Holosericum, or a stuff made of silk only, was worn by
none but ladies of the first rank.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But men of the greatest quality,
and even princes, were contented with subsericum, or a stuff made
of half silk; to that Heliogabulus is remarked for being the first
who wore holosericum<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. In the reign of the emperor Justinian, a
trial was made for bringing silk-worms alive to Constantinople, but
without success; however, two monks who had been employed in
the affair, repeated the trial with silk-worms eggs.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The
experiment succeeded so well, that to this Constantinopolitan
colony, all the silk-worms, and silk manufactures in Europe owe
their existence and origin. Till the middle of the twelfth century,
all the silken stuffs at Rome and other parts of Europe were of
Grecian manufacture. But Roger I. King of Sicily, about the year
1138, invading Greece with a fleet of vessels with two or three
benches of oars, called Galeæ or Sagittæ (from whence are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
derived the words galley and saique) and sacking and plundering
Corinth, Thebes, and Athens, brought away to Palermo, among
other prisoners, a great number of silk weavers to instruct his
subjects in that art. From them, as Otto Trisingensis de gestis
Frederici, lib. I. cap. 23. informs us, the Italians soon learnt the
method of manufacturing silk.</p>

<p>Lady Frances did not restrain farmers, or the sons of farmers
from shooting, as none are better entitled to game than those
whose property is the support of it.</p>

<p>Mr Burt devoted his time much to his grand-children, though
he was far from wishing to obtrude too much knowledge on their
tender years, as the mind may be overstrained by too intense
application, in the same way as the body may be weakened by too
much exercise before it arrives at its full strength.</p>

<p>Quintilian compares the understanding of children to vessels
into which no liquor can be poured but drop by drop. But there is
a certain season, when our minds may be enlarged&mdash;when a great
stock of useful truths may be acquired&mdash;when our passions will
readily submit to the government of reason&mdash;when right principles
may be so fixed in us, as to influence every important action of our
future lives. If at that period it is neglected, error or ignorance are,
according to the ordinary course of things, entailed upon us. Our
passions gain a strength that we afterwards vainly oppose&mdash;wrong
inclinations become <a name="Corr8a"></a>too confirmed in us, that they defeat all
our endeavours to correct them. A superior capacity, an ardent
thirst for knowledge, and the finest dispositions, soon discovered
themselves in Lord Munster; particularly a singular warmth of
affection, and disinterestedness of temper. And although experience
evinces, that memory, understanding, and fancy, are seldom
united in one person, yet he is one of those transcendant geniuses,
who is blessed with all three. Mr Burt treated him always with that
distant condescension, which, though it encourages to freedom,
commands at the same time respect. He appeared in different
characters to him, that he might find something new and agreeable
in his conversation.</p>

<p>Montaigne says; 'there is nothing like alluring the passions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
affections; otherwise we only make asses loaded with books.'
Exquisite is the fruit produced by a right temperature of the
different qualities, and mixture of the world and philosophy,
business and pleasure, dignity and politeness. The Romans
termed it <i>Urbanitas</i>, the Greeks <i>Atticism</i>.</p>

<p>At the age of sixteen years the Earl of Munster having received
every advantage education could bestow on him, fully answered
the most sanguine expectations his aunt had formed of him. She
then insinuated to him his dependent situation&mdash;her own
intentions of marrying, the great expenses she had been at in the
various improvements she had made on the estate, which rendered
it necessary for him to apply himself to business, as it
would disable her from doing so much for him as she would
have inclined: that as she had bestowed on him every advantage
of education, the alternative before him was that of <i>application</i>
on his part, or the utmost severity of <i>censure</i> on that of the
world.</p>

<p>Lady Frances adopted this plan with Lord Munster to keep him
ignorant of her intentions in his favor, that she might not obstruct
his exerting all his physical and moral strength in acquiring that
knowledge and virtue he at present so eminently possesses.
Though a man of rank born to a large fortune may have fine
natural parts, yet it takes a great deal to make him a <i>great man</i>. His
splendid titles and large estate, are in some degree a bar to those
acquirements, as he rests secure in his rank and independent
fortune. How would the number of the nobility be reduced, were
only those allowed to assume that title who could make good their
claim to it by the distinguished endowments which raised the
founder of the family? A man of rank who is a jockey at
Newmarket rises no higher in my estimation than the lowest
mechanic. Men of literature are the only nobility known in China:
In other countries the laws inflict punishment <i>on criminal actions</i>:
there, they do more; <i>they reward virtue</i>. If the fame of a generous
action is spread in a province, the mandarin is obliged to acquaint
the emperor, who presently sends a badge of honor to the person
who has so well deserved it. Be their birth ever so low, they
become mandarins of the highest rank, in proportion to the extent
of their worth or learning. On the other hand, be their birth ever
so exalted, they quickly sink into poverty and obscurity if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
neglect there studies which raised their fathers<a name="Corr9" />.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The care, attention, and labour incumbent on men for their
support, invigorate both the soul and the body, and they are the
natural causes of health and sagacity. Virtue itself would be
indolent if she had no passions to conquer and regulate. It is every
way our advantage that we have no such slothful paradise as the
poets feigned in the golden age: and the alledged blemishes in
nature, are either the unavoidable accompanyments or consequences
of a structure, and of laws subservient to advantages,
which quite over-balance these inconveniences, or sometimes the
direct and natural means of obtaining those advantages. The
situation of the King of Sardinia, environed on all sides with
powerful monarchs, obliges him to act with the greatest
circumspection; which circumstance seems to have formed the
character of that house.&mdash;As Lady Frances was desirous of her
nephew's understanding commerce, she proposed his becoming a
merchant:&mdash;with great modesty, and deference for her opinion, he
submitted to her, whether the confined maxims of a trader were
not destructive of the social virtues; if they did not tend to destroy
those refined feelings of the soul that distinguish man from man?<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
She answered, 'What situation is like that of a man, who with one
stroke of a pen makes himself obeyed from one end of the world
to the other? his name, his signature, has no necessity, like the
army of a Sovereign, for the value of metal to come to the
assistance of the impression: himself does all; he has signed, and
that is enough.'</p>

<p>Lord Munster replied, 'that there were two ranks in life he
should prefer as more suitable to the title he bore, though
unaccompanied by fortune, the magistrate who supports the laws,
or that of the soldier who defends his country!' Highly charmed
with his sentiments, it required no small resolution for his aunt,
who fondly loved him, to support the character she had assumed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
but recollecting herself, observed, that it was not unusual for men
of high birth to enrich their family <i>by trade</i>.</p>

<p>When the Earl of Oxford was at the head of affairs in England,
his brother was a factor at Aleppo; and if Lord Townshend was
respected in parliament as a secretary of state, his brother was no
less regarded in the city as a merchant. Without giving way, added
she, to ideas of birth, you may be happy, and by your temper,
application, and personal accomplishments, make a figure in life
without the aid of such an accidental <i>appendage</i>; and by your
attainments and engaging qualities obtain a general esteem, the
surest step to advancement and honor.</p>

<p>Lord Munster seemed <i>convinced</i>, though not allured by her
arguments, yielding himself to her guidance, with that sweetness
of disposition, which though so amiable in itself is so much to be
apprehended. For those dispositions of the mind, which are
generally termed virtuous, are frequently the occasion of our falling
into vices, from which opposite ones, though generally condemned,
would have secured us.</p>

<p>In pursuance of Lady Frances's plan, Lord Munster was sent to
Holland, where he was boarded for two years in a creditable family
in Amsterdam, as the best school for learning, temperance,
economy, and every domestic virtue.</p>

<p>Men of all climates and religions being also natives of Holland,
gave him liberal notions and enlarged ideas; their earth is as free
as their air. Their toleration of religion, indeed, is so extreme, it
amounts to a total unconcern about them. At the same
communion, in the same church, some receive sitting, others
standing, or kneeling; and this freedom appeared to that crafty
people, such unquestionable policy, that it came in from common
sense alone, and passed without a law.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> To this cause is assigned
the number of inhabitants; as the land fit for tillage in Holland
does not exceed four hundred thousand acres<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. This country in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
itself furnishes an illustration of the plan Lady Frances was
following with her nephew. Industry, honesty, and concern for the
public welfare, made the inhabitants considerable. If they depart
from these, and if the sea returns upon them, their having existed
will be known only from tradition and books. The preservation of
both Egypt and Holland depends upon the care they take of their
dykes, and canals; but there is no work in the former so great as
the building such a city as Amsterdam upon piles in the sea<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.
Venice also furnishes a striking instance of what wonders may be
effected by industry: that out of a morass, a city of such splendor
could be raised, and become the emporium of Europe, as it was
before the discovery of the East and West Indies, is extraordinary.
But this trade decayed, as that of Holland increased: almost all
merchandizes which came from the Mediterranean were formerly
landed at Venice, and from thence brought to Augsburg; from
which place, they were dispersed through all Germany. But
Holland has taken away all, and distributes all; and Augsburg
suffers, as well as Venice, Milan, Antwerp, and an infinite number
of other cities, which are at <i>present</i> as <i>poor</i> as <i>formerly</i> they <i>were rich</i>.
This furnishes an excellent example of the benefits arising from
industry, and the necessity of exertion. Lord Munster rendered
himself entirely master of the knowledge of our English trade and
privileges. He also attained a competent skill in the history of
jurisprudence<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. As it is requisite for every man who has leisure
and capacity for such researches to be acquainted with the nature
and extent of that judicial authority which is to decide upon his
person and property, and to which as a citizen he is bound to
submit, he studied the English constitution and government in the
ancient books of common law, and more modern writers, who out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of them have given an account of this government. He next
proceeded to the history of England, and with it joined in every
king's reign the laws then made&mdash;&mdash;This gave him insight into
the reason of our statutes, and shewed him the true ground upon
which they came to be made, and what weight they ought to have.
By this means he read the history of his own country with
intelligence, and was able to examine into the <i>excellence</i> or <i>defects</i> of
its <i>government</i>, and to judge of the <i>fitness</i> or <i>unfitness</i> of its <i>orders</i>
and <i>laws</i>: and by this method he knows enough of the English law
for a gentleman, though quite ignorant of the <i>chicane</i> or wrangling,
and captious part of it, or the arts how to <i>avoid</i> doing <i>right</i>, and to
<i>secure himself</i> in <i>doing wrong</i>. As Lord Munster was now eighteen
years of age, Lady Frances wrote and acquainted him, that as he
had rather testified a dislike to the mercantile scheme, she desired
he would relinquish it; and as nothing contributes more to
enlighten and improve the understanding, than a <a name="Corr10"></a>personal
acquaintance with foreign climates, she desired he would
travel.&mdash;The man who by his birth-right is a free member of
society, not a slave to despotic power, and who, in matters of
religion, enjoys the invaluable blessing of private judgment, should
not fail to visit other nations; for this will not only rub off all the
selfish asperities he may have contracted from a narrow survey of
things, but will also accompany him home with a more rational
attachment to that constitution under which he had the happiness
to be born. Heaven has placed us in a most advantageous
situation; unless we are divided at home, attacks from abroad may
molest but cannot ruin us. Our laws are the laws of freedom; our
merchandise the traffic of opulence&mdash;&mdash;Our constitution is
framed and joined together by the choicest parts, picked and
extracted from aristocracies, democracies, and sovereignties. We
have a natural force to <i>defend</i> and <i>maintain</i> the empire of the seas.
We enjoy wealth and possessions in both the Indies, if we do not
lose them by our own misconduct&mdash;&mdash;We boast at regular
choice, and singular system of parliamentary government, so nicely
calculated, as to be at once the defence and the support of the
kingdom and the people. Our Sovereign has the power&mdash;but the
parliament has still the law of that power<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.&mdash;What people on earth
can say the same? The studies Lord Munster made of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
constitution, when contrasted with his observations of other
countries, made him return after three years, not a <i>nominal</i>, but a
<i>real</i> patriot. This is not always the case. Too many of our young
gentlemen bring home only a miserable reverse of every good
purpose for which they were sent out:&mdash;as none travel more than
the English, they ought, therefore, to let none surpass them in
manly or generous perceptions. But we have reason to fear that
what Mr Pope observes of <i>one</i> of them may be applicable to <i>most</i>.</p>

<p class="center-block">
'<i>Europe he saw, and Europe saw him too.</i>'
</p>

<p>Is not this owing to their early visiting France, where slavery is so
artfully gilded over as to hide its natural deformity? If our countrymen
were first to make the tour of Denmark, where the people are
more apparently slaves, it would remedy this evil. On the contrary,
when the subject of an arbitrary government has travelled into
countries which enjoy the inestimable advantages of civil and
religious liberty, he returns with a diminished affection for his
own, and learns to despise and dislike that constitution which
denies him the enjoyment of those natural rights, the knowledge
and the value of which he has learnt from his happier neighbours.</p>

<p>Hence it is that despotic princes are cautious how they permit
their subjects to <i>range abroad</i>; and for the reasons above intimated,
travelling has ever been encouraged in free states.</p>

<p>With the finest person, Lord Munster possessed all the virtues
and the graces&mdash;&mdash;was all complacency in his manners, all
sweetness in his disposition; humane, susceptible, and compassionate.</p>

<p>While Lady Frances had taken so much care of his education, it
may be readily supposed she was not forgetful of Lady Eliza's, his
sister&mdash;whose person is faultless, and of the middle size&mdash;her face
is a sweet oval, and her complexion the <i>brunette</i> of the bright kind.
The finest passions are always passing in her face; and in her
lovely eyes there is a fluid fire sufficient to animate a score of
inanimate beauties. She has a clear understanding, and a sound
judgment; has read a great deal, and has a most happy elocution:
possesses a great share of wit, and with equal strength and
propriety can express the whole series of the passions in comic
characters. The pliableness of her dispositions can raise and keep
up agreeable sensations, and amuse her company.</p>

<p>Lord L&mdash;&mdash; declares he never saw anything equal to her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
even on the French stage, in the article of transition from passion
to passion in comic life. She is perfect mistress of music, and plays
admirably well on the harpsicord; having great neatness, and more
expression and meaning in her playing, than is often found among
lady-players.&mdash;In this, as in every other branch of her education,
she has had every advantage&mdash;Lady Frances herself being highly
accomplished&mdash;and her long residence in Italy and France having
perfected and improved her taste, in every accomplishment that
can embellish or add graces to the youth and beauty of her
niece&mdash;All her musical band have been the pupils of the first
masters, and recommended to her by Santirelli, Jomelli, Galuppi,
Piccini, and Sacchini. It is not then surprising that the works of
these different masters are performed admirably well at Munster-house;
and as there is great variety in their manner, there is that in
every one of them to charm and please the most insensible. Lady
Frances is highly charmed with Jomelli; while the fancy, fire, and
feeling of Galuppi, and Piccini's comic <a name="Corr11"></a>style, are infinitely more
attracting to Lady Eliza, than the taste, learning, great and noble
ideas of Jomelli, or the serious style of Sacchini.&mdash;One of the
Bezzodzi's, from Turin who <a name="Corr12"></a>excels on the hautboy, is also at
Munster-house.</p>

<p>There is also a set of very excellent actors, who perform at the
Tribuna, judging the representation of dramatic works of genius
contribute as much to soften manners, as the exhibition of the
Gladiators formerly did to harden them. When we complain of the
<i>licentiousness</i> of the stage, I fear we have more reason to complain
of <i>bad measures</i> in our policy, and a general decay of <i>virtue</i> and <i>good
morals</i> among us.</p>

<p>Moliere's comedies are said to have done more service to the
courtiers, than the sermons of Bourdalone and Massillon. The
great Saint Chrysostom, a name consecrated to immortality by his
virtue, is thought to owe a great part of his eloquence and
vehemence in correcting vice, to his constantly reading Aristophanes;
nor was he even censured on that account, in those times
of pure zeal, and primitive religion.</p>

<p>Lord Shaftesbury says, 'Bigotry hurries us away into the most
furious excesses, upon trifles of no manner of consequence.' What
is more useful to a nation than the picture of strong passions, and
their fatal effects; of great crimes, and their chastisement; of great
virtues, and their reward? Scarce had Peter the Great polished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Russia, before theatres were established there. The more
Germany has improved, the more of our dramatic representations
has it adopted. Those few places, where they were not received in
the last age, are never ranked among civilized countries: and
theatrical entertainments have their use everywhere, and often
keep the common people from a worse employment of their
time&mdash;and so far were the institution of theatres from being the
fore-runners of slavery, or the badges of despotism, that they were
most encouraged, and flourished best in free states.</p>

<p>It is easy to conceive that the acquaintance of Lady Frances was
much courted, as no private person had it so much in their power
to entertain their company so well; there being every requisite at
Munster-house to delight the heart, please the eyes, and satisfy
the understanding.&mdash;No person of any taste but would blush to
acknowledge they have not been in Shropshire to admire her
buildings, manufactures, schools<a name="Corr13"></a>, etc.&mdash;And it fares with her merit
like the pictures of Raphael, which are seen with admiration by all,
or at least no one dare own that he has no taste for a composition
which has received so universal an applause.</p>

<p>Upon Lord Munster's being of age, she was thirty-seven; yet
the regularity of her life contributed to make her lose no more in
her person than what might be considered as the slight touches in
a picture, which when faded diminish nothing of the master-strokes
of the piece. Lord Darnley, since the time he had expected
to become Lady Frances's husband, still continued to attach
himself to her. 'Whatever her determinations may be,' said he, 'I
am sensible of the value of her soul; her friendship is more tender
than the endearment of love in other women.' Such forbearances
were not uncommon in ages of chivalry; and however justly
ridiculed by the inimitable <i>Cervantes</i>, when carried to extremes,
and terminating in Quixotism, yet it appears to constitute a capital
part of the character of <i>a true</i> knight. Lord Darnley's attachment
to Lady Frances was not founded on the weakness of his intellects;
it never made him forgetful of his duties to society. He is at the
same time a philosopher and a politician; and adds practice to
speculation, experience to knowledge, in both these departments.
Though the brilliant actions of some heroes are only handed down
to us, and we view their characters through the magnifying end of
the tube, yet Hercules himself could lay aside his club, and amuse
himself with the distaff, to enjoy the company of the woman he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
loved. All great souls have descended occasionally, and divesting
themselves of their heroism, have become susceptible of the <i>tender
passion</i>.</p>

<p>Lady Frances respected Lord Darnley's character, as much as
she loved his person; and the time was now arrived when she
proposed ingenuously to confess to him the reasons of her past
conduct, and to offer to dedicate the remainder of her life in
rewarding his tender, fond, faithful attentions. But she suspected
that&mdash;years had made such an alteration in her person, that she
ceased to be an object <i>of love</i>, (to his lordship) although perfectly
convinced she possessed <i>his esteem</i>&mdash;Under this apprehension it
became impossible for her to act the part she intended&mdash;She
became disquieted, and was determined, had that really been the
case, never to have allied herself to any other. After revolving a
thousand things, she at last determined to confirm or confute her
hopes, by employing a particular friend, and a relation of Lord
Darnley's, to discover his sentiments. Lady Frances's intimacy with
this lady had commenced at Paris, when they were in the convent
of the &mdash;&mdash;. As her character is peculiar, the indulgent reader
will perhaps pardon the introduction of her story in this place.</p>

<p>At the time Lady Frances returned to England, Mrs Lee was
taken out of the convent to be married. Her parents, dazzled with
Mr Lee's wealth, forgot to attend to other requisites to render that
state happy. Without his being a man of very shining parts, he had
such talents as made him acceptable to women, in particular to a
girl so young as she was when this alliance took place. He sung
and danced well, was lively to extravagance, full of agreeable
trifling, and always in good humour: add to this, he was handsome
in his person, liberal to excess, and calculated for the seduction of
the fair. Mrs Lee's great beauty, her parents partially flattered
themselves would fix his affections.&mdash;All the graces of which the
figure and emotions of a female were capable, were united in her;
but his love for her was nothing but an impulse of passion which
soon subsided. Addicted by his natural disposition to pleasure, he
despised those which a tender sensibility renders so exquisitely
delightful; such would have trespassed too much on his vanity.
Unexperienced and artless, his innocent wife could not long retain
his affections, and in the few years she lived with him,
encountered many mortifications; first from the alienation of his
affections, afterwards from the distressed situation of his affairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
which entirely changed his temper, rendering him impatient and
passionate. His very footmen were taught to insult her, and every
one in the family knew the most effectual way to ingratiate
themselves with him, was to disregard his wife. Yet she bore it all
with patience, and acted her part with prudence, endeavouring to
disarm his anger with gentleness. She sometimes, indeed,
lamented and complained, but the dove and the lamb do so
too&mdash;'The poison of grief exhales only in complaints.'&mdash;She was
neither sullen nor gay when he was out of humour; nor
impertinent or melancholy when he was pleased&mdash;She obliged her
affections to wait and submit to the various turns of his
temper&mdash;trying to bribe his passions to her interest. She
endeavoured also, by economy and proper attention, to retard as
long as possible, the ruin that threatened him; and considerably
diminished the household expenses.</p>

<p>This pleased her husband; he wanted to retrench, without
appearing less magnificent; for his prudence (or rather his desire
of saving at home to squander abroad) was still subordinate to his
ostentation. But all these innocent stratagems were ineffectual;
spending his whole time between women, racing, and gaming, one
excess succeeded another, until his affairs were intirely involved.
Previous to this, Mrs Lee had resigned her jewels to pay one of his
game debts, which she afterwards saw adorning a girl he kept. The
world saw he devoted himself only to objects of contempt, and
pitied his neglect of a woman of her merit, and who was still
handsome, having that style of beauty which is the image of a
sensible heart, though sorrow and tears had deprived it of its
freshness. This laid her open to the assiduity of men of gallantry,
who are generally obliging enough, upon such occasions, to offer
their assistance to dry up a <i>pretty woman's tears</i>. It is to be
confessed a woman under these circumstances is in a very
<i>dangerous situation</i>.</p>

<p>None of Mr Lee's conduct was founded on propriety&mdash;he was
witty, kind, cold, angry, easy, stiff, jealous, careless, cautious,
confident, close, open, but all <i>in the wrong place</i>. She often retired
into her closet, and wept the silent hours away for his hard-heartedness&mdash;yet
without one unkind word or reproach. Her
parents were dead, Lady Frances at a distance, her sorrows of a
complicated kind, which required great delicacy to discover; she
had no person to open her heart to, none to whom she could pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
forth the sorrows of the soul! she had a susceptible heart, and no
object she took any interest in, or who participated in her
trials.&mdash;This situated, (the candid must acknowledge) she was
perhaps more to be <i>pitied</i> than <i>blamed</i>, in permitting another object
to glide insensibly into her affections&mdash;more especially as he was
introduced by Mr Lee, as one to whom she was indebted for his
life and fortune.</p>

<p><i>The first</i> he had defended, when two gamblers, his adversaries,
were on the point of killing him; <i>the last</i> he had preserved by
discovering a scheme that had been practised on him by them
when inebriated by liquor, to which he was much addicted. Her
husband left her young and unexperienced heart to all the tortures
and pangs of jealousy, and that <i>ennui</i> attending an unoccupied
heart; after flattering herself, as she had done nothing to deserve
the estrangement of his affections, that they would be as
permanent as her own. Why did he forsake her; why did he lay her
open to temptations? her heart might have been his own, had he
not cruelly abandoned her&mdash;at any rate it was too good to form
another tye, had he not at last added <i>contempt</i> to <i>neglect</i> and his
cruel usage at last would have animated a statue, at least I may
safely declare nothing warmed with flesh and blood could bear it.
A man of this humour is to be beloved only in the way of
christianity&mdash;that is the utmost obedience which can be allowed
to the commandments of God, and the authority of religion.</p>

<p>Were I obliged to draw a picture that should represent the
happy union between an elevated soul, a penetrating mind, and a
heart in which sweet humanity resides, I would form it entirely of
the person and features of Mr Villars; and I fancy that all who had
any just idea of those three qualities might perceive them plainly
expressed in his form, look, and demeanor. Mr Lee pressed him
to be much at his house; and as his <i>innocent</i>, though <i>oppressed</i>, wife
had been kept in constant alarms concerning the consequences of
his gaming&mdash;&mdash;she could not but look on Mr Villars as the favour
of her fortune, and on one to whom she might be indebted for her
husband's reformation. I shall not expatiate on the sweetness and
charms of his voice, of his noble appearance, and of the tincture of
melancholy which softens the vivacity of his fine eyes; but what
distinguishes him from most other men is the sentimental look of
modest virtue, which never gives offence. He is not in the least a
slave to interest; but as he is no stranger to the necessities of life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
his conduct is always regular, and he never abandons himself to
any excess. Such is and was Mr Villars. Mrs Lee very soon
perceived his partiality for her&mdash;circumstanced as she was, his
attentions were dangerous&mdash;but she could not with any propriety
forbid him <i>a house</i> to which her husband so constantly <i>invited him</i>,
without letting him see she mistrusted herself&mdash;more especially as
he never failed in his respect for her.</p>

<p>He became her only comforter and friend; and if from her
youth and inexperience she was likely to fall into even the
appearance of any error, it was this kind, this friendly monitor that
guarded her from it.</p>

<p>His attentions became as necessary to her soul, as aliments of
food are to the support of the body, while the respectful distance
of his behaviour proved to her his passion was controlled by his
respect.</p>

<p>Some surmises were at length insinuated to Mr Lee, to his
wife's dishonour. He paid little attention to them&mdash;but coming
home one night flushed with wine, and finding Mr Villars alone at
supper with her, (no unusual matter, and by his own request) he
drew his sword, and wounded him before he had time to defend
himself! Mrs Lee fainted away&mdash;&mdash;on her recovery she removed
herself from a house to which no entreaties on his part could
prevail on her to return&mdash;declaring she would live no longer with a
man who could at once suspect her virtue, endanger his friend's
life, and ruin her reputation.</p>

<p>The world talked differently about this affair. Should not the
example of the law be followed, which is so tender in criminal
cases, that delinquents are often found <i>not guilty</i>, for want of legal
evidence, at the same time that the court, the jury, and every one
present at the trial feel the strongest <i>moral</i> conviction of their <i>guilt</i>?
Scandal on the contrary always gives its most important and fatal
decisions from <i>appearances</i> and <i>suppositions</i>, though reputation is
dearer to a woman of honor than life itself. Mrs Lee experienced
the malevolence of her own sex particularly. What, said they, could
engage Mr Villars to devote all his time to her? is not friendship
between a man and a woman a chimera, the mark of a passion
which honor or self-interest bids them conceal? But whilst the
world represented this affair in the worst colours, Lady Frances
wrote her an affectionate letter, offering her assistance, and
begging she would communicate her real situation, that she might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the more effectually be enabled to serve her; to which Mrs Lee
returned the following answer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="indent-4">
'Dear Madam.<br />
</p>

<p>I received the honor of your letter, and find myself elevated
by your notice&mdash;if there can be pride that ranks with virtues,
it is that we feel from friendships with the worthy. The liberal
<a name="Corr14"></a>sentiments you express, are a proof of the goodness of your
heart&mdash;&mdash;I have ever thought that to believe the worst is a
mark of a mean spirit, and a wicked soul; at least I am sure,
that the contrary quality, when it is not due to weakness of
understanding, is the fruit of a generous temper. In return for
your generosity, I will lay open my whole heart to you; and if
in consequence I lose your esteem, I shall at least have the
satisfaction resulting from a consciousness of my candour.
This is a liberty I should have taken before, had it not
proceeded from the timidity I felt in unbosoming myself to
one whose virtues I dreaded, and in discovering <i>my weakness</i>
to one who I think has <i>none of her own</i>. Your ladyship knows
the trials I suffered for many years; my conduct under the
severest mortifications human nature could sustain. I was
wounded in my affections, condemned and insulted in my
person, impoverished in my circumstances: I still had strength
of mind to regulate myself so as to meet your approbation: no
species of calamity was unknown to me, nor were there
wanting those of the other sex, who judged from my situation
they might have a chance of succeeding with me, if I was
weak enough to listen to them&mdash;but they soon gave up the
pursuit, judging the excess of my misfortunes had hardened
my heart entirely against certain impressions. But this was so
far from being the case, that my sorrows, my sufferings,
rendered my heart (naturally tender) more susceptible of that
refined passion, which, when dignified by respect, and
softened by tenderness, found so ready access to it<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
<p>In short, circumstanced as I was, if it is a crime to love, I
am very culpable! but had I unfortunately proceeded to any
act contrary to my engagements with Mr Lee, I myself would
have acquainted him with it, though, in the opinion of many,
he would not have deserved so much candour from me.</p>

<p>This being the real state of the case, I flatter myself your
ladyship will think me more <i>weak</i> than <i>wicked</i>, more <i>frail</i> than
<i>culpable</i>, more <i>unfortunate</i> than <i>indiscreet</i>. And I must now
acquaint you, that I am determined never to return to my
husband&mdash;I have consulted my reason on this subject, and
when we have done so, whatever the decision be, whether in
favour of our prejudices, or against them, we must rest
satisfied, since nothing can be more certain than this, that he
who follows that guide in the search of truth, as that was
given to direct him, will have a much better plea to make for
his conduct, than he who has resigned himself implicitly to
the guidance of others. My maxim is, our understanding,
<i>properly</i> exercised, is the <i>medium</i> by which God makes known
his <i>will</i> to us; and that in all <i>cases</i>, the voice of impartial
reason is the <i>voice of</i> God. Were my marriage even to be
annulled, all the theologians in the world could not prove the
least impiety in it.&mdash;Milton wrote <i>the doctrine and discipline of
divorce</i>; wherein he proves, that a contrariety of mind,
destructive of felicity, peace, and happiness, are greater
reasons of divorce than adultery, especially if there be no
children, and there be a mutual consent for separation<a name="Corr15"></a>.</p>

<p>He dedicated the second edition to the parliament of
England, with the assembly of divines&mdash;&mdash;The latter
summoned him before the house of Lords, who, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
approving his doctrine, or not favouring his accusers,
dismissed him. Necessary and just causes have necessary and
just consequences: what error and disaster joined, reason and
equity should disjoin.</p>

<p>I see no reason why those who upon the evidence of more
than fourteen years experience are unsuited to each other,
<i>joined</i> not <i>matched</i>, should live disagreeably together, and exist
miserably&mdash;merely for the inadequate satisfaction of exulting
upon the degree of their patience in having to say they did <i>not
part</i>. A person may mistake in fixing love without knowledge
of the party, but he cannot err that finds cause to dislike from
woeful experience. It is, indeed, convenient for the lords of
the creation to inculcate another doctrine, upon the same
principles that the extreme and timorous attention to his own
security made James I. very anxious to infuse into his subjects
the belief of divine hereditary right, and a scrupulous
unreserved obedience <i>to the power which God had set over them</i>.
Mr Villars, who is now reconciled with my husband, has
written to intercede in his behalf, assuring me of his
penitence and affection. Boileau has observed, that it is an
easy matter in a <i>Christian poem</i> for <i>God</i> to bring <i>the devil to
reason</i>. Could I believe that all my husband did, were the
effects of love, it would not in the least alter my resolution,
since I should consider a person whose affection had such
dreadful effects, as dangerous to my repose, as one whose
anger was implacable.&mdash;&mdash;What signifies it to me whether it
be love or hatred by which I suffer, if the danger and
inconvenience be the same? I am certain were we to live
together again, whenever we met we should as naturally
quarrel as the elephant and the rhinoceros. Reconciliations in
the marriage state, after violent breaches, are seldom lasting,
and after what has passed between us, like the father of the
gods and the queen of heaven, we shall be the best company
when <i>asunder</i>.</p>

<p>He says his conduct proceeded from an excess of love! I
desire to be subject no more to such excesses! I am content to
be moderately beloved; nor shall I ever again give occasion
for such extraordinary proofs of affection. Were I to act
otherwise, it would afford too much encouragement for the
men to use their wives ill. <i>Too good subjects are apt to make bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
kings.</i> He has my consent to live with any woman who can
delight in such a <i>loving husband</i>, while I will force him to
esteem my conduct, and irritate his animosity by declining a
reconciliation. We are tired with perpetual gratitude, and
perpetual hatred.&mdash;&mdash;He wishes to be reconciled to me, not
from any religious motive, or return of affection, his animosity
being still the same&mdash;but because he is tired of acting the part
of a provoked husband.</p>

<p>I am piqued at Mr Villars's interesting himself in this
matter. I shall not answer his letter for a week; I mistrust my
own vivacity.</p>

<p>Our imagination is often our greatest enemy: I am striving
to weary mine before I act. Business like fruit hath its time of
maturity, and we should not think of dispatching it while it is
half ripe. The Cardinal de Retz said, 'I have all my life-time
held men in greater esteem for what they forbore to do on
some occasions than for what they did.'</p>

<p><a name="Villa"></a>I have here a most delightful dwelling&mdash;&mdash;It is thatched,
and covered on every side with roses, wood-bines, and
honey-suckles, surrounded with a garden of the most artful
confusion. The streams all around murmur, and fall a
thousand ways. A great variety of birds are here collected,
and are in high harmony on the sprays. The ruins of an abbey
enhance the beauties of this place: they appear at the distance
of four hundred yards from the house; and as some great
trees are now grown up among the remains, and a river winds
among the broken walls, the view is solemn, the picture fine.
Here I often meditate on my misfortunes.</p>

<p>Could I flatter myself I should ever be honored by your
presence, how happy I should be!&mdash;--Your eye, I am sure,
would catch pleasure while it measures the surrounding
landscape (even at this season of the year) of russet lawns and
grey fallows, on which stray the nibbling flocks: the
mountains too, which seem to support the labouring clouds,
add sublimity to the charming scene. When I take a walk after
a sedentary occupation, I feel a sensible pleasure; rest in its
turn becomes agreeable, if it has been preceded by a
moderate fatigue. Every action of our lives may be converted
into a kind of pleasure, if it is but well timed: Life owes all its
joys to this well-adapted succession; and he will never enjoy
its true relish, who does not know to blend pleasure with
dissipation. I ask pardon for detaining your ladyship so
long&mdash;My cousin Lord Darnley has been to see, and admires
my cottage.&mdash;I perceive plainly he flatters himself that you
will one day make him happy. I do not presume to offer my
advice; it would be imitating the savage chief, who marks out
to the sun the course it is to take&mdash;&mdash;but surely his
respectful, uninterrupted attachment deserves your consideration.
Were I not perfectly convinced of his worth and
sincerity, I should be <i>the last</i> person to speak in his behalf.
The bitterness of conjugal repentance, which I have
experienced, is beyond all others poignant; and happy it is if
<i>disunion</i>, rather than perpetual <i>disagreement</i>, results from it.</p>

<span class="indent-4">Obliged and affectionate friend,</span>
</p>
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Lucy Lee</span>.'
</p>
</div>

<p>Lady Frances returned Mrs Lee immediately the following
answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">'Dear Madam,</td><td align="right">Munster-house.</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>I return you many thanks for the confidence you honored
me with; and I sincerely sympathize with you on the many
disagreeable events that have occurred to you. If my
approbation can confer on you any satisfaction, you possess it
in a very eminent degree: for though I cannot approve of your
sentiments concerning divorce, etc. yet your conduct in your
family was exemplary.</p>

<p>There is no reasoning about the motions of the heart.
Reflection and sensation are extremely different&mdash;our affections
are not in our own power, though yours seem to have
been under proper regulations.</p>

<p>I am not surprised at the calumny you met with. Many
people stoop to the baseness of discovering in a person
distinguished by eminent qualities, the weaknesses of humanity,
while there is scarcely to be found an honest heart, who
knows how to render a noble and sincere homage to another's
superiority. I acknowledge myself guilty with respect to you,
of a too common instance of injustice, that of desiring that
others would always <i>conduct themselves</i> by our maxims! I am
the more culpable, as I entirely agree with you in thinking
that all our actions should proceed from the fixed principles
we have adopted. I never pay a blind deference to the
judgment of any man, or any body of men whatever. I cannot
acquiesce in a decision, however formidable made by
numbers, where my own reason is not satisfied. When the
mind has no <i>data</i>, no settled principles to which it may recur
as the rule of action, the agent can feel little or no satisfaction
within himself, and society can have no moral security
whatever against him.</p>

<p>The most permanent, the most pleasing enjoyment the
human soul is capable of entertaining, is that which arises
from a consciousness of having acted up to that standard of
rectitude which we conceive to be the proper measure of our
duty: and the best grounds on which we can expect others to
place confidence in us, is the assurance we give them that we
act under the influence of such moral obligations. This
principle has influenced my conduct: and as you say you are
absolutely determined never to live with your husband again;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
although my sentiments do not correspond with yours on that
head, I will add nothing further on that subject, but refer you
to certain passages in scripture, which I think on sober
reflection must invalidate your present opinion<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>The caprice you have often tacitly blamed me for
respecting Lord Darnley, had you known the motives for, you
would have approved&mdash;I will now in reward for your candour
<i>to me</i> be equally sincere <i>with you</i>&mdash;trusting to your honor, that
you will not <i>divulge</i> what is it so material to me to <i>conceal</i>.</p>

<p>At the time I agreed to give Lord Darnley my hand, I was at
liberty to indulge my inclinations, and to devote myself
entirely to him: But on my father's death, when I found the
estate in my possession, I considered myself as mother to my
brother's children. This was my motive for rejecting the man
I (<i>did</i>, and do <i>now</i>) fondly love: who by his generous and
friendly, his respectful and tender behaviour, deserves every
thing from me. Whoever pretends to be without passions,
censures the wisdom of that Power which made him; and if
men of sense (for they alone are capable of refined pleasure)
would so far admit love, as not to exclude their necessary and
more important duties, they need not be ashamed to indulge
one of the most valuable blessings of an innocent life. I honor
the married state: and have high ideas of the happiness
resulting from an union of hearts. Domestic society is
founded on the union betwixt husband and wife. Among all
the civilized nations, this union hath been esteemed sacred
and honorable; and from it are derived those exquisite joys,
or sorrows, which can embitter all the pleasures, or alleviate
all the pains in human life. The heart has but a certain degree
of sensibility, which we ought to be economists of. Lord
Darnley engrossed my whole soul; nothing could afford me
any pleasure which had no reference to him.&mdash;He was ever
uppermost in my thoughts, and I bestowed only a secondary
reflection on all other subjects.</p>

<p>I could have cheerfully, for his <i>conversation</i>, abandoned all
society on earth beside, and have been more blessed, than if,
for them, I had been deprived of <i>his</i>. But if we suffer one
particular duty (even the worship of the Deity) to engross us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
entirely, or even to encroach upon the rest, we make but a
very imperfect essay towards religion, or virtue; and are still at
a considerable distance from the business of a moral agent.
"The dial that mistells one hour, of consequence is false
through the whole round of day."</p>

<p><i>Virtue</i>, in my acceptation, is nothing else than that principle
by which our actions are <i>intentionally directed</i>, to produce
good, to the several objects of our free agency. I was aware,
that it was not only necessary that I should mean to act a right
part, and take the best way which could direct me to effect it,
but that I should previously take those measures which were
in my power to acquire the knowledge of my duty, and of the
weaknesses I had to guard against. I was sensible, that, had I
given my hand to Lord Darnley, I would have been defective
in the duties incumbent on me to my own family:&mdash;Love
would have taken entire possession of my soul, and shut up
the avenues of my heart against every other sentiment. Upon
this occasion I felt how justly the sacrifice of our own
happiness is placed among the highest virtues. How painful
must it be to the most generous heart! Men lose their lives to
honor&mdash;I relinquished my love&mdash;the life of life. I am sensible
I have been condemned for permitting him to be so much
with me: but what recompence can the world bestow on me,
for relinquishing the society of a real and tender friend?
Common attachments, the shadows of friendship, the issue of
chance, or fantastic likings, <i>rashly cemented</i>, may as hastily be
<i>dissolved</i>: but mine has had the purest virtue for its basis, and
will subsist whilst vital breath in me remains. My affections
are founded on those amiable qualities, which are seldom
united, and therefore but little liable to be displaced. My
partiality is founded on esteem: take away the cause, the
effect will cease. The dread of the world has never yet
withheld me from following the bent of my own inclinations,
and the dictates of my own heart, not the dread of censure
ever influenced my conduct.</p>

<p>Your mention of his continued attachment is highly
flattering, and very pleasing&mdash;There you touched the tenderest
springs of my heart, bring me down to all the softness of
my sex, and press upon me a crowd of tender, lovely, ideas&mdash;</p>

<p>If the consciousness of good-will to others, though inactive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
be highly delightful, what a superior joy have I not
experienced, my dear friend, in exerting this disposition, in
acts of beneficence! Is not this the <a name="Corr17"></a>supreme enjoyment in
nature? It is true, the great works I have carried on, the
encouragement I have given to learning, the manufactories I
have introduced into this kingdom, etc. etc. have procured me
the suffrage of the world, and may transmit my name down to
posterity. But what flatters me most is, that if I have acquired
any fame, it is derived from the man I love. My acquaintance
with him, has been a happiness to my mind, because it has
improved and exalted its powers. The epithet of <i>great</i>, so
liberally bestowed on princes, would, in most cases, if
narrowly scanned, belong rather to their ministers. Unassisted
by Agrippa and Mecænas, where should we have
placed Augustus? What is the history of Lewis XIII. but the
shining acts of Richelieu? Lewis XIV. was indeed a great
king; but the Condés, the Turennes, as well as the Luvois,
and Colberts, had no small share in acquiring the glories
of his reign. In all situations of life, it is of great
consequence to make a right choice of those we confide
in&mdash;It is on that choice our own glory and peace
depend.&mdash;But it is still more so to princes, or persons of
large property. A private man will find a thousand persons
ready to open his eyes, by reproaching him with the wrong
steps into which bad advice drew him; whereas courtiers, or
those who are interested, approve and applaud whatever the
prince or the great person does. An ingenious courtier
replied to his friend, who upbraided him with his too great
complaisance for the emperor who had made bad verses,
which he commended; "Would you have me have more
sense than a man who commands twelve legions, and can
banish me?"</p>

<p>That day my nephew is of age, I shall assign over his estate,
and acquaint him of his obligations to Lord Darnley, to
whom, at the same time, I shall offer my hand, if I have
reason then to think it shall be agreeable to him. If it should
not, I shall be mortified, though I shall not deck my brow
with the plaintive willow. I need not tell you how agreeable it
will be for me to see you at this place, which is considerably
improved since you were here last. This day month I give a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
feast, in imitation of the Saturnalia<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>; make me happy by your
presence on that occasion.</p>

<p>Mrs Lee, soon after the receipt of the above letter, came to
Munster-house, where she generally resided during the winter
months, (after her separation from her husband) retiring to her
cottage in Wales, in the summer.</p>

<p>Lady Frances had always a select number of friends with her.
Notwithstanding her passion for music, she kept the performers in
their own line; and though she venerated the liberal sciences, and
contributed so largely to their cultivation, their several professors
only waited on her by invitation: by this means she had it always in
her power to suit her company, and never to be intruded on; as
the best things are irksome to those whose inclinations, tastes, and
humours, they do not suit.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned Mrs Norden, who had the care of
Lady Frances's education, and who now continued <a name="Corr18"></a>to reside with
her: this Lady's seriousness was happily contrasted with Lady
Eliza's sprightliness, while Lady Frances's scientifical knowledge
was agreeably relieved by the strokes of nature observable in Mrs
Lee&mdash;who declared she had never read, or studied, any more than
to assist her decyphering what was incumbent her <i>to understand</i>. 'I
hate your wise ones,' said she, 'there is no opinion so absurd but it
has been mentioned by some philosopher.' She is nature itself,
without disguise, quite original disdaining all imitation, even in her
dress, which is simple but unaffected. She plays most divinely on
the fiddle. Her genius for music is sublime and universal. She
holds the fiddle like a man, and produces music in all its genuine
charms, raising the soul into the finest affections.</p>

<p>An aunt and sister of Sir Harry Bingley's were also much at
Munster-house. Miss Bingley was of the same age with Lady
Eliza: to the charms of a regular beauty she joins all those of a
cultivated mind, together with a disposition replete with candor,
and a turn for ridicule; two things rarely joined together&mdash;as a
calm dispassionate love of truth, with a disposition to examine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
carefully, and judge impartially, with a love of diverting one's self
at other people's expense, seldom meet together in the same mind.
Mrs Dorothea Bingley is a maiden lady of fifty, possessed of a
large independent fortune, which she proposes to bestow on her
niece. She was in her youth very handsome: but having lived all
her life in the country, she derived all her ideas of love from the
heroic romance. To talk to her of love was a capital offence. Her
rigour must be melted by the blood of giants, necromancers, and
paynim knights. She expected, that, for her sake, they would retire
to desarts, mourn her cruelty, <i>subsist</i> on <i>nothing</i>, and make light of
scampering over impassable mountains, and riding through
unfordable rivers, without recollecting, that, while the imagination
of the lover is linked to this <i>muddy vesture of decay</i>, she must now
and then condescend to partake of the carnality of the vivres of the
shambles.</p>

<p>Those of the other sex who were mostly at Munster-house,
were, Lord Darnley, Sir Harry Bingley, Sir James Mordaunt, etc.
etc. etc. Great marriages had been proposed to Lady Frances; but
she had ceased long to be importuned on that head. When Lord
Munster was of age she gave a splendid entertainment to the
neighbourhood, which finished with a ball. The day after she
shewed her nephew the state of her affairs, when she succeeded to
the estate: and that, exclusive of the buildings, etc. etc. she had
already doubled it: that the perpetual burdens she had entailed on
it, did not amount to one quarter of the advanced rents, which
would continue to encrease: that she had put aside for Lady
Eliza's fortune fifty thousand pounds, and an equivalent sum for
herself, and then with great pleasure resigned the remainder to his
Lordship, who she was happy to find so worthy of filling the place
of his ancestors. She at the same time acquainted him with her
motives for concealing her intentions in his favor, and that, had
she seen him addicted to any irregularities, she would not have
assigned over the property so soon to him&mdash;as the law of this
country does not interfere like that of France, where, if a person,
before he attains the age of twenty-five, wastes his fortune by
anticipation, or other means, and is in a fair way of ruining
himself, and, perhaps, his family; the government interposes:
guardians of his estate are appointed, and his person may be
detained in custody till he arrives at that age; but <i>there</i> the
jurisdiction stops. The acknowledgments of Lord Munster are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
easier to be conceived, than expressed&mdash;he concluded by saying,
'he hoped Lady Frances would always consider Munster-house as
still her own, and make it her principle residence!' She smiled,
and looking to Lord Darnley, said, 'Having my lord performed my
duty to this family; it is now in my power to make myself happy by
conforming to your wishes&mdash;Sixteen years ago, I had singly an
engagement to fulfil; but I have now a breach of it to repair.' Lord
Darnley's joy may easily be supposed great on this occasion, who
had maintained for Lady Frances, for so long a time, an
uninterrupted attachment.&mdash;They were married a few days
afterwards. Never did Ph&oelig;bus gild a more auspicious day;
never did Cupid inspire two lovers with a higher sense of each
other's merit; and never did Hymen light his torch with a
greater complacency, than to reward that constancy which remained
invincible in Lord Darnley, without even being supported
by hope.</p>

<p>The part Lady Darnley performed would have been difficult for
another; but the club which a man of ordinary size could but lift,
was but a walking-stick to Hercules.</p>

<p>No one enjoyed this wedding more than Mrs Dorothea Bingley.
A sixteen years courtship corresponded entirely with her ideas of
the right and fitness of things. She harangued her niece and Lady
Eliza on this subject, telling them that Lady Darnley is the only
woman she knows in this degenerate age, that has acted up to the
propriety of the ancients&mdash;that she respected the sublimity of her
ideas. She was very desirous of her niece's marrying a Mr Bennet,
because he made love in heroics, was inebriated in his science,
and thought all the world considered him as a Phoenix of wit.
Miss Bingley would often reason with her aunt on this subject? 'Of
what use in the world (said she) is an erudition so savage, and so
full of presumption?'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One moral, or a mere well-natur'd deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does all desert in sciences exceed.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i32"><span class="smcap">Sheffield</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Mrs Dorothea always insisted that he was a classical
scholar, and a fine gentleman! The niece declared he was a Pagan,
and ought to have lived two centuries ago, as he spoke a language
she did not understand! 'He may be learned (said she) but he has
no passion!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>'No passion (replied Mrs Dorothea) how comes he then to write
such fine letters?'</p>

<p>'The fine letters (replied Miss Bingley) show memory and fancy,
but no sensations of <i>the heart</i>! lovers who make use of extravagant
tropes are reduced to that expedient, to supply the defect of
passion by the deceitful counterfeit of hyperbolical language. The
passions of <i>the heart</i> depend not on the deductions of <i>the
understanding</i>&mdash;but it was necessary he should have a <i>Corinna</i>,
because Ovid had <i>one</i>; and he makes me inconstant, although I
never gave him any encouragement, because Gallus's favourite run
away with a soldier. He seems to be intimately acquainted with the
history of Cupid and Venus, but knows nothing <i>of love</i>: and would
be sooner applauded for writing a good elegy, than have his
mistress smile on him.'</p>

<p>Mrs Dorothea told her, that she was exceedingly perverse, but
she would give her leave <i>to talk</i>, as she had the power <i>to do</i>.</p>

<p>Miss Bingley said, 'Since Mr Bennet was so much in her good
graces, she made no doubt but he would pay her his homage, on
the smallest hint, would transfer his affections&mdash;as the foundation
of his passion was <i>the same</i> for <i>both</i>, built on that of her <i>mansion</i>,
would <i>grow</i> with her <i>trees</i> and <i>increase</i> with her <i>estate</i>&mdash;&mdash;Increase,
you know, my dear aunt, is the end of marriage; and your fortune
is better than Medea's charm, for that only made an old man
young again; but your riches will make a young man enamoured of
an old woman! He will swear you are not only wiser than Minerva,
but fairer than the Paphian queen! Though you are old, your trees
are green; and though you have lost the roses in your cheeks, there
are great plenty of them on your pleasure-grounds.'</p>

<p>Mrs Dorothea with great good-humour laughed at her niece's
sallies, saying, 'You remember what Martial says;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Fain would kind Paula wed me if she could:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I won't, she's old; if older yet, I would.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'But seriously, niece (said she) you will never make a choice that
I shall so much approve of&mdash;he has so much wit.'</p>

<p>Miss Bingley replied, that all the credit he has for wit is owing
to the gratification he gives to others ill-nature: and said she would
be very happy to accommodate herself to her aunt's wishes; but
was not upon such a religious strain, and so desirous of
canonization hereafter (if sufferings can make a saint) as to marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
a man of his character, that she might have her <a name="Corr19"></a>mortifications and
punishments in this life: but at the same time would faithfully
promise never to marry any man she disapproved of.</p>

<p>There were great rejoicings for some weeks at Munster-house:&mdash;at
which time Lord and Lady Darnley set out for their estate in
Dorsetshire, and Lady Eliza accompanied Lord Munster to
London. As a correspondence commenced at this period between
the parties I have already introduced to the reader, the sequel of
this history will appear from their letters. I shall only observe, that
Lord Munster's figure was remarkably agreeable, his address
engaging; he first attracted, and then commanded the admiration
of all who knew him. On the slightest acquaintance with him, a
most exact regard to all the proprieties and decencies of life were
observable in his conduct; and such an evident desire to oblige,
and to make all about him easy, as became a good mind and a
liberal education. An agreeable chearfulness made his conversation
as lively and agreeable as it was useful and instructing. But
the discerning eye of friendship could discover that he was not
happy, and that delicacy to the feelings of his friends restrained
him from giving way to an uneasiness, which it was too apparent
he laboured under. His general behaviour bore the genuine stamp
of true politeness, the result of an overflowing humanity and
benevolence of heart. Such qualities very justly and forcibly
recommend, lying obvious to almost every observer; but to the
more discerning, a nearer view of him quickly discovered
endowments far above the common standard. He had, in truth,
endowments of mind to have honored any station.</p>

<p>As Lady Darnley's breast glowed with that exalted fervent
charity which embraces the wide extended interests of men, of
communities, of the species itself; it is easy to conceive how her
heart exulted at finding her nephew so deserving of all she had
done for him. But though she felt the greatest satisfaction at his
being so conformable to her wishes, and his fortune so adequate
to his beneficence; the same sensibility rendered her wretched for
the evident melancholy in which he was plunged. Her social
affections ever awake, even on those whose objects lie beyond the
nearer ties of nature, on many occasions gave her most painful
sympathetic feelings; so deeply was she interested in the fortunes
of all with whom she had any connection. How then must she
mourn to observe, that, notwithstanding the possession of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
advantage of person and wealth, her nephew was miserable!&mdash;If
men would but consider how many things there are that riches
cannot buy, they would not be so fond of them&mdash;for all the
outward advantages Lord Munster had, were, to a man in his
situation of mind, <i>landscapes</i> before a <i>blind man</i>, or <i>music</i> to one
that <i>is deaf</i>.</p>

<p>Delicacy kept Lady Darnley from interrogating her nephew on
the subject of his grief; sensible that the remotest desire <i>from her</i>,
must amount to a command <i>to him</i>. She only, at parting,
insinuated the happiness it would afford her to see him ally
himself suitably to some lady of merit: and, as Lady Eliza was to
accompany him to town, requested him to moderate her liveliness,
and to be a careful observer of her conduct.</p>

<p>'I never see (said she) a single man, who hath passed middle age
in celibacy, where no particular security arises from his profession
or character; but I think I see an unsafe subject, and a very
dangerous instrument for any mischief that his <i>own</i> parts may
<i>inspire</i>, or <i>other men's</i> may <i>prompt him</i> to: As to other achievements
of virtue, a distinction <i>ought</i>, I think, to be <i>made</i>; because, in
common acceptation, there is a variety of things which pass under
that name, and are generally applauded, which, properly estimated,
would not <i>deserve it</i>. A regard to posterity hath carried arms, arts,
and literature, further than any other motive ever did or could.
Who is so likely to be influenced by this regard as they who are to
leave behind them the darling pledges of their affection, in whom
they hope to have their names continued, and all the fruits of their
study, toil, and exploits, abiding and permanent?' Lord Munster
assured the Countess, that he would ever think it his glory to
conform to her wishes in ever respect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after Lord Munster's arrival in London, he wrote Lady
Darnley the following letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

From the Earl of Munster to the<br />
Countess of Darnley.<br />
</p>

<p>'My Dear Aunt,</p>

<p>Over powered as I am with a weight of obligations, I should
think myself highly wanting to my own feelings, were I in any
one instance in my future life to leave you dubious of my
gratitude, or the earnest desire I have of conforming to your
wishes.</p>

<p>You have, my dear Madam, expressed your desire I should
marry; but that, my dear aunt, is impossible at present. But I
revere that state: men who laugh at a serious engagement,
have never known the allurements of modesty when blended
with affability; nor felt the power of beauty, when innocence
has increased its force. This has been my case, and my heart
is already a prey to a hopeless passion. But it is necessary to
carry you back some years, in order to give a recital of its
commencement.</p>

<p>The amiable character of Mr Vanhagen, my landlord at
Rotterdam, you are already acquainted with: his humanity
and benevolence inspired me with the greatest respect. The
advantages his countrymen have over us, are their industry,
vigilance, and wariness: But they in general exert them to
excess, by which means they turn their virtues into vices.
Their industry becomes rapine, their vigilance fraud, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
wariness cunning. But my worthy landlord possessed all the
virtues.</p>

<p>He had in the early part of his life resided much at Venice,
and brought from thence the economy and frugality which
distinguish them in their private families, their temperance,
their inviolable secrecy of public and private affairs, and a
certain steadiness and serenity to which the English are
supposed to be utter strangers. His long residence there,
made him well known to the duchess de Salis, whose distant
relation he had married.</p>

<p>This lady had resided some years at Rotterdam with her
family. She was only daughter to the Count de Trevier, was
heiress to a large fortune, and possessed exquisite beauty,
good-sense, and every accomplishment that was likely to
preserve and to improve the authority beauty gives to make it
<i>indefectible</i> and <i>interminable</i>. But the duke, her husband,
unfortunately was soon satiated with the regularity of her
virtues: His affections could not long be preserved by a
woman of her amiable undisguised character. When custom
had taken off the edge from his passion, he endeavoured to
rouse his torpid mind by a change of object. That vivacity
which the tender passions impart to pleasure, was a powerful
incentive for him to indulge them. His heart found fresh
delight in gallantry, to which he was naturally prone: a
dangerous delight, which, habituating the mind to the most
lively transports, gives it a distaste to all moderate and
temperate enjoyments: from thence forward the innocent and
tranquil joys which nature offers, lose all their relish. His
sophisticated mind made him blind to the merit of his wife,
who loved him tenderly.&mdash;She felt most severely his neglect,
and contracted insensibly a settled melancholy, which served
the more effectually to alienate his affections from her. She
became miserable:&mdash;and no temper can be so invincibly good
as to hold out against the siege of constant slights and
neglects. Misfortunes she had strength of mind to support,
and death she could have encountered with greater resolution
than the displeasure and peevishness of the man she loved.
Wherever there is love, there is a degree of fear&mdash;we are
naturally afraid of offending, or of doing any thing which may
lessen us in the esteem of an object that is dear to us: and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
we are conscious of any act by which we may have incurred
displeasure, we are impatient and miserable, till, by intreaties
and tokens of submission, we have expiated the offence and
are restored to favor.</p>

<p>By the duchess's earnest solicitude to please, she destroyed
her own purpose, and her obedience, like water flung upon a
raging fire, only inflamed her husband's follies; and therefore,
when he was in an ill humour, the duke vented his range on
her. He did not care <i>how</i> often <i>he quarrelled</i> with, or, to speak
more properly, how often he <i>insulted</i> her; for that could not
be called a quarrel wherein she acted no part but <i>that of
suffering</i>. But though his displeasure was grievous to her, yet
she could bear it better than his indifference&mdash;for resentment
argues some degree of regard. But whilst she was
breaking her heart for him, he passed his time in gallantry&mdash;though
his affections were always the satire of a woman's
virtue&mdash;the ruin of a woman's reputation.</p>

<p>A favourite mistress, by pursuing a different plan from that
of the duchess, secured his affections. She kept alive his
ardour by her caprices. <i>Affectation</i> always exceeds the <i>reality</i>.
But is not the extravagance of some men's fancy to be pitied,
who lodge all their passions in a mistress, a dog, or a horse,
which but in general do them no service but what they are
prompted to through necessity or instinct? Art and cunning
are <i>unknown</i> to a woman of virtue, whose conduct is
determined by her principles, whose anxiety alone is excited
by affection.</p>

<p>After five years, in which the duchess had a son and a
daughter, and in which she had experienced many of the
<i>vexations</i>, but few of the <i>satisfactions</i> of a married state; the
duke left her, and resided entirely in Paris with his mistress.
She retired to the country, to a family-seat of her father's,
and devoted her time entirely to the education of her
children, and that of a young lady (of great beauty and
fortune) whose mother with her last breath bequeathed to her
care.</p>

<p>She from time to time wrote the duke letters, expressing
great resignation, and such a tenderness for him as she
thought might have power to touch his heart. "I am obedient
to your wishes," said she, "I will not urge, with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
unwelcome word, this unkindness&mdash;I'll conceal it&mdash;If your
heart has made a choice more worthy, I forgive it&mdash;pursue
your pleasures&mdash;drive without a rein your passions&mdash;I am the
mistress of my own mind, that shall not mutiny&mdash;If I retrieve
you, I shall be thankful&mdash;If not, you <i>are</i> and must be still <i>my
lord</i>."</p>

<p>To letters such as these she never received any answer! as
the charms of a woman's eloquence never have any force,
when those of her person are expired (in the eyes of her lover
I mean): it might be perhaps as easy to persuade a man to
dance, who had lost the use of his limbs.</p>

<p>I shall pass over the first ten years of her retirement, as
they furnish nothing more than the unwearied attentions she
took in employing every means for the instruction of her son,
daughter, and ward. I shall only observe, that the regularity of
her conduct gained her the esteem of every one. She was a
friend to virtue under any denomination, and an enemy to
vice under any colour. She established an institution for the
provision of the infirm and destitute. This was constructed on
that wise and excellent plan, that excludes the undeserving
from participating in the charity, and extends only to those
who, from their real necessities, are proper objects of
benevolence.&mdash;At that period she was advised to take her son
to the capital. But she wisely considered that the education
which commonly attends high birth or great fortune, very
often corrupts or sophisticates nature; whilst in those of the
middle state she remains unmixed and unaltered. I have
somewhere read; <i>Jamais les grandes passions et les grandes vertus
ne sont nées, &amp; ne se sont <a name="Corr20"></a>nourries que dans le silence &amp; la retrait.
L'homme en societé perd tous ses traits distinctifs: ce <a name="Corr21"></a>n'est plus qu'
une froide copie de ce qui l'environne. Voilà pour quelle raison on
nous accuse de manquer de caractere: nous ne vivons pas assez avec
<a name="Corr22"></a>nous-mêmes, &amp; nous empruntons trop des autres</i>.</p>

<p>The duchess procured for her son's tutor, a very
respectable man, who was at the utmost pains in forming his
morals, and improving his understanding; while so many of
the degenerate nobility in great cities are trifling away their
time and their fortunes, in idle dissipations, in sensual
enjoyments, or irrational diversions, and making mere
amusement the great business of their lives. Happiness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
merit are the result, not so much of truth and knowledge, as
of attaining integrity and moderation. Many ridiculed the
duchess's plan of education, of debarring herself from those
pleasures and enjoyments her youth, rank, and beauty so well
intitled her to: But she often observed it would be the height
of imbecility to judge of her felicity by the imagination of
others; considering nothing under the title of happiness, but
what she wished to be in the possession of, or what was the
result of her own voluntary choice. Women of the world
counteract their intention, in so assiduously courting
pleasure, as it only makes it fly further from them. They will
not understand, that pleasure is to be purchased, and that
industry is the price of it; to reject the one, is to renounce the
other. They are to learn that pleasure, which they idolize,
must now and then be <i>quitted</i> in order to be <i>regained</i>. They
have tried in vain to perpetuate it, by attempting variety and
refinement. Their fertile invention has multiplied the objects
of amusement, and created new ones every day, without
making any real acquisition. All these fantastic pleasures,
which are founded on variety, make no lasting impressions on
the mind; they only serve to prove the impossibility of
permanent happiness, of which some women entertain
<i>chimerical expectations</i>: but the duchess was too rational to make
amusement her principal object. A woman that is hurried
away by a fondness for it, is, generally speaking, a very useless
member of the community: A party of pleasure will make her
forget every connection: and she is often sick without
knowing <i>where</i> her complaint <i>lies</i>, because she has nothing <i>to
do</i>, and is tired of being <i>well</i>.</p>

<p>The duchess had loved her husband passionately. If any
person had a desire of ingratiating themselves with her, they
had only to begin by him: To praise, to please, or admire him,
opened to them a reception in her heart. But our best virtues,
when pushed to a certain degree, are on the point of
becoming vices: She soon found she was to blame, in
dedicating herself too fondly even <a name="Corr23"></a>to this beloved object. She
exhausted her whole sensibility on him, and in proportion to
the strength of her attachment, was the mortification she
endured in being abandoned by him. But had not even this
been her fate, the extravagant excesses of passion are but too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
generally followed by an intolerable langour. The woman who
wishes to preserve her husband's affection, should be careful
to conceal from him the extent of <i>hers</i>: there should be always
something left for him to expect. Fancy governs mankind: and
when the imagination is cloyed, reason is a slave to caprice.</p>

<p>Women do not want judgment to determine, penetration to
foresee, nor resolution to execute; and Providence has not
given them beauty to create love, without understanding to
preserve it. The pleasures of which they are susceptible, are
proportioned to the capacity and just extent of their feelings.
They are not made for those raptures which transport them
beyond themselves: these are a kind of convulsions, which
can never last. But there are infinite numbers of pleasures,
which, though they make slighter impressions, are nevertheless
more valuable. These are renewed every day under
different forms, and instead of excluding each other, unite
together in happy concert, producing that temperate glow of
mind which preserves it vigorous, and keeps it in a delightful
equanimity. How much are those of the fair-sex to be pitied
who are insensible to such attainments, and who look upon
life as gloomy, which is exempt from the agitation of unruly
passions! As such prepossessions deprive them of pleasures
which are much preferable to those which arise from
dangerous attachments, the duchess knew how to make
choice of her amusements, and <i>improved</i> her <i>understanding</i> at
the same time that she <i>gratified</i> her <i>feelings</i>. Life to those who
know how to make a proper use of it, is strewed with delights
of every kind, which, in their turn, flatter the senses and the
mind; but the latter is never so agreeably engaged as in the
conversation of intelligent persons, who are capable of
conveying both instruction and entertainment. The duchess
preferred the conversation of <i>such</i>, to <i>men of the world</i>; being
sensible she had every thing <i>to gain</i> on <i>one side</i>, and every
thing <i>to lose</i> on <i>the other</i>.</p>

<p>The Baron de Luce resided in the same part of the
country. He was a man of great gallantry, wit, and humour.
He judged it impossible that a woman in the bloom of beauty,
possessed of the united advantages resulting from rank,
riches, and youth, should retire to an obscure part of the
world, and sequester herself from (what he judged) the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
pleasures of life, without being <i>compelled</i> by her husband or
<i>prompted</i> by some secret inclination which she wished to
conceal. Determined to unravel this mystery, and to amuse
himself during the time he staid in the neighbourhood, he
tried to insinuate himself into her good opinion&mdash;but without
giving any offence she avoided entering into his plans. He still
persisted in his intentions, judging, as he wrote well, the
duchess would be glad to enter into a correspondence; but he
found nothing in the reception she gave him that was for his
purpose, <i>to embellish the history of his amours</i>. But what he
undertook at first from vanity, became at last sufficient
punishment for him. The more he saw of her conduct the
more his respect increased, but which instead of making him
relinquish his <i>intentions</i> (from a conviction of the inefficacy of
the pursuit) made him persist <i>in them</i>, as he <i>then felt</i> the
passion which at <i>first he feigned</i>.</p>

<p>The duchess knew the predicament on which she stood;
but as <i>the hatred</i> of men of a certain character is <i>less</i>
pernicious than <i>their love</i>, she gave orders never to admit him
into her presence. The good or bad reputation of women
depends not so much upon the propriety of their own
conduct, as it does upon a lucky or unlucky combination of
circumstances in certain situations. Some men calumniate
them for no other reason, but because they are in love with
them. They revenge themselves upon them for the want of
that merit which renders them despicable in their eyes. This
was the case with the Baron; he insinuated there were
reasons which he knew that rendered it highly proper for the
duchess to live in the manner <i>she did</i>, speaking in a <i>style</i> which
conveyed more than met the ear! The people he addressed
greedily listened to what seemed to bring the duchess more
on a footing with themselves; a thousand stories were
circulated to her prejudice (though innocence itself): Thus if
there be but the least foundation for <a name="Corr24"></a>slander, some people
believe themselves fully authorized to publish whatever malice
<i>dares invent</i>. But there are no enemies more dangerous to the
reputation of women, than lovers that cannot gain the
reciprocal affection of their mistresses. These reports were
confirmed from another cause&mdash;A lady of fortune in the
neighbourhood became much attached to a man who resided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
with the duchess as her son's tutor; he was ingenuous,
sensible, and much respected. She offered him her hand, and
as she possessed a handsome fortune could not conceive how
he could decline that happiness. As he was constantly at
home, agreeable to the stories that had been circulated, she
concluded at once (and then affirmed) he was a favourite of
the duchess.</p>

<p>Self-love is of the nature of the polypus; though you sever
her branches or arms, and even divide her trunk, yet she finds
means to reproduce herself. In consequence of the information
the duke received from this lady, who wrote to him in the
character of an anonymous friend, he left Paris and his
mistress abruptly; and, to the great surprise of his wife, came
to&mdash;. He accosted her in a distant, but respectful manner.&mdash;Nothing
gives so sharp a point to one's aversion as good-breeding&mdash;The
duchess, unconscious of having given him
any occasion of offence, was highly delighted at his return,
flattering herself with a return of his affection. And as she
considered him the aggressor, received him graciously,
insisting that no mention should be made of past transactions;
assuring him that she still retained the same love for him, and
as she regarded him as the first of human beings, had
perhaps been too sanguine in expecting his constancy, as so
many temptations must occur from his superiority to the rest
of mankind. She thought he was but too amiable&mdash;that his
very vices had charms beyond other <a name="Corr24a"></a>men's <i>virtues</i>. Adding that
(grievous as his neglect had been to her) yet she had never
done anything that could reflect upon his honor! He heard
her in a sullen humour; his inclinations <i>were revived</i> by
remarking, that time, instead of <i>diminishing</i>, had <i>added to her
charms</i>: this increased his resentment, and he answered, that
the worst a bad woman can do, is to make herself ridiculous;
it is on herself only that she can entail infamy&mdash;but men of
honor have a degree of it to maintain, superior to that which
is in a woman's keeping. Had she had a mind to retaliate, she
might easily have said, that a man of honor and virtue which,
in themselves indeed, are always inseparably connected, are
but too often separated in the absurd and extravagant
opinions of mankind. For what a strange perversion of reason
is it, to call a person a man of honor who has scarcely a grain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of virtue! She only observed, we are indeed civilized into
brutes; and a false idea of honor has almost reduced us into
Hob's first state of nature, by making us barbarous. Honor
now is no more than an imaginary being, worshipped by men
of <i>the world</i>, to which they frequently offer human sacrifices.
He told her she needed not <i>be troubled for her minion</i>: and
retiring to rest, left her quite at a loss to account for his
conduct.</p>

<p>It is not sufficient we know our own innocence; it is
necessary, for a woman's happiness, not to be suspected.</p>

<p>For unfortunately after she has been once censured
(however falsely) she must expect the envenomed shafts of
malice ever ready to be let fly at her, and that in the
transaction of any affairs that will admit of two interpretations
(to avoid the worst, and enjoy an unblemished reputation). It
is not enough to govern herself with propriety, there must be
nothing that will carry two interpretations in the <i>accidents of
her life</i>: A woman must therefore be necessarily always guilty,
when innocence has need of many justifications. Happy are
those who are not exposed to such inconveniences!</p>

<p>The Duke most <a name="Corr25"></a>injudiciously next morning publicly
dismissed the object of his jealousy, and, by his want of
prudence, confirmed every thing that had been falsely
alledged against his innocent wife, who continued ignorant of
it for some months.</p>

<p>When acquainted with it&mdash;The less ground she saw for
the reports against her honor, the more courage and greater
resolution she had to condemn them. She thought herself
unfortunate to have lost the merit of her innocence by
scandalous reports which she thanked Heaven she had not
incurred by her guilt: and was so far from slighting the
probabilities that might confirm opinions founded against her,
that she by no means thought herself in the same situation
with others, who had never <i>been contemned</i>, and that
consequently she was not at liberty to act on some occasions
as <i>they might do</i>.</p>

<p>How many women <i>err</i> from the obstinacy of people in
defaming them&mdash;they give up the point, despairing of
success in conciliating the esteem of a world who never <i>retract
censure</i>&mdash;It is not with detraction as it is with other things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
that displease by repetition: Stories that have been told a
thousand times, are still new when revived to the prejudice of
another. The duchess bore all these calumnies with patience,
<i>which</i> was never yet a <i>solitary virtue</i>: like an angler she
endeavoured to humour the duke's waywardness, flattering
herself that her study to please would conquer his disagreeable
temper; and that if she could not become a pleasing wife,
she might at least be thought an agreeable companion, a
serviceable friend. Hope was the only blessing left us, when
Pandora's fatal box let out all the numberless evils which
infest these sublunary regions. But she was at last obliged to
resign all ideas of submitting longer to his caprices. He
became jealous even of his menial servants; and she could
speak to no man without incurring his suspicions; which
produced to her the most mortifying scenes. Like that
conqueror of China, who forced his subjects into a general
revolt, because he wanted to oblige them to cut their hair and
their nails, he reduced her to form the resolution of leaving
him, because (as he represented it) <i>he had dismissed a servant</i>.
But it was in reality his temper and abuse that occasioned
it&mdash;and when she was under the necessity of taking that step,
she rather let the world judge amiss of her, than justify
herself at her husband's expense. No condescensions on her
part could affect <i>him</i>, as daily experience convinced her, that
from a consciousness of the part he <i>himself had acted</i>, he could
never <i>love her</i>. Are there not many occasions in life in which it
would be reasonable to say, <i>I conjure you to forget and forgive
the injury you have done me</i>?</p>

<p>They at last parted amicably: she came to Rotterdam with
her family, and there I contracted an intimacy with her son,
who was an amiable young man about my own age. There I
first beheld the lovely Adelaude, Countess de Sons, the
duchess's ward: the first time I saw <i>her</i>, and the charming
Julia, I know I had <i>a heart</i>; until then I was insensible&mdash;These
young ladies were instructed in all the arts of Minerva; Julia
was skilled in music; but the countess's voice was, accompanied
with the lyre, more moving than that of Orpheus. Her
hair hung waving in the wind without any ornament, which
the duchess had taught her to despise: her motions were all
perfectly easy, her smiles enchanting! Without dress she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
beauty, unconscious of any, and thus were heightened all her
charms.</p>

<p>The marquis enquired what I thought of his sister, and her
fair friend? I answered, "They were charming," and asked if it
was possible he had resisted the charms of the beautiful
countess? He replied, "I will own to you, my dear friend, I
have not:<a id="Corr26a"></a> Adelaude is formed for love; my heart is naturally
susceptible; she has been my constant companion: he must be
something more, or something less than a man (a god or a
devil) who hath escaped, or who can resist love's empire.&mdash;The
gods of the heathens could not; Jupiter, Mars, Mercury,
Apollo, their amours are as famous as their names: so that
sturdiness in human nature, where it is found, which can
resist, argues plainly how much the devil is wrought up in the
composition. But if my sensibility had not been so great, yet
so many opportunities she has had to engage my affections,
could not fail of rivetting me her's for ever," "You are
beloved then" said I hastily. "Yes," replied he, "Adelaude
calls me her dearest brother; but entertains no ideas beyond
that relation; and I am fearful of letting her know the extent
of my sentiments, lest it should render her constrained in her
manner to me; and the charming <i>naiveté</i> of her behaviour
forms the charms of my life! The marks of that innocent
affection, which first attached me to her, have hitherto been
looked upon as a childish play: and as no one has troubled
their head about the consequences of it, I have taken care to
profit by the liberty allowed me.&mdash;You make me no
answer!&mdash;Wherefore this gloomy silence, your dejected air,
and languishing looks?<a name="Corr26"></a>" I pretended an indisposition, and left
him under the greatest oppressure of spirits; I loved, I adored
the charming Countess! judge then of the horror of my
situation.&mdash;</p>

<p>How many sacrifices could I not willingly have made to
friendship! My passion I thought was indeed the only one I
could not make: how was it possible I should? but convinced
of the happiness of my rival, what did I not suffer? I saw a
pair of happy lovers, suited to each other; I thought it would
be safe to alienate her affections; and considered myself only
in the light of a dependent on your bounty: in such a
situation, had my friend been uninterested, could I hazard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
addressing a young lady of the countess's rank and fortune? I
became melancholy and <i>distrait</i>. Many people, and particularly
those who have no idea of that delicacy of passion
peculiar to susceptible minds, looked on me as a particular
kind of a young man. To please such persons, I must have
devoted my time to them: you will easily conceive then, I
could well enough bear the want of their good opinion. Such
become the artificers of their own misfortunes, by the false
idea they form of pleasure, and they philtre (if I may use the
term) their own sorrows.</p>

<p>It was what is called pleasure, that sunk into ruin the
ancient states of Greece; that destroyed the Romans, that
overturns cities; that corrupts courts; that exhausts the
fortunes of the great; that consumes youth; that has a retinue
composed of satiety, indigence, sickness, and death. But <i>my
passion</i>, as much as a <i>dislike</i> to their <i>manner of life</i>, secured me
from <i>their dissipations</i>. The constant endeavours I used to
suppress an inclination I could not overcome, had a fatal
effect on my constitution&mdash;I was threatened with a consumption!&mdash;This
I carefully concealed, lest your kindness should
have urged my removal from a place, which I could not
determine to quit: though I carefully avoided the sight of
those who were interesting to me in it.</p>

<p>At this time the marquis received a peremptory command
to rejoin his father. He came to me in the greatest distress:
"How", said he, "can I resolve to leave the countess?&mdash;She is
now beautiful as an angel, exclusive of her immense fortune;
to remain single cannot possibly be long in her power, for her
beauty must necessarily strike every eye, and charm every
heart. But I will go and unburthen myself to my father; her
riches and rank will insure his approbation. You, my friend,
alone are acquainted with the secret of my heart. See the
lovely Adelaude often; to you I confide the secrets of my soul.
Farewel."</p>

<p>The marquis set out, and soon informed me that his father
would not yet hear of his marriage, and had insisted on his
immediately joining a regiment in which he had procured him
a command: It was in time of war; his honor at stake, and love
was subordinate to his glory. The susceptible mind is capable
of enjoying a thousand exquisite delights to which those are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
strangers, whose pleasures are less refined; but what chagrin,
what regret, what pain does not so delicate a passion bring on
the heart that entertains it? <i>Quand on est né trop tendre, on ne
doit pas aimer</i>, says some French author. But the sufferings of
my friend could not equal mine; the object of my passion
being daily before my eyes heightened my inquietude. The
general characters of men, I am apt to believe, are
determined by their natural constitutions, as their particular
actions are by their immediate objects. The innocent marks of
partiality she honored me with, made me in constant fears of
acting dishonorably to the marquis. The duchess fell soon
after into a languishing illness, which in a short time put a
period to her life: The duke came, but <i>too late</i>, to receive her
last breath. He at first appeared inconsolable for her death;
but his grief insensibly decreased, and softened into that
mournful and tender regard, which a sense of her merit, and
his own unkindness to her, could not fail of exacting from
him. Disgusted at an union, which had caused him (from his
own errors) so much uneasiness, he formed a resolution
carefully to avoid entering again into a similar engagement.
But he saw every day before him the lovely Adelaude: he
loved her; it was perhaps impossible for him to do otherwise.
He declared his passion; but was rejected: The countess told
him her affections were engaged! Next day I received the
following letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From the Countess de Sons to the Earl of Munster.</p>

<p class="indent-2">My Lord,</p>

<p>I am well aware of the delicacy which prescribes certain
observances to our sex. But there is no rule in life which must
not vary with circumstances. Come to me this evening: Julia
will be with me&mdash;Adieu.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Adelaude</span> de <span class="smcap">Sons</span>.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>I went&mdash;Abashed at the step she had taken, the cheeks of
the lovely Adelaude glowed with the most lovely red; her eyes
sparkled with the brightest lustre; while the loves and graces
hovered around her charming form, and fluttered on her
breast&mdash;Love, almighty love, preceded her steps, when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
approached me. Heavens! how quick my heart beat at that
instant with pleasing hope! I endeavoured to speak to her, but
hesitated and trembled. After a few moments' expressive
silence, I desired to know what commands she meant to
honor me with? She was greatly confused, but at length told
me the dilemma she was in from the declaration of the duke's
passion. To support my politics, I began and talked of my
friend.</p>

<p>She told me that his partiality was no secret to her,
although he had never disclosed it, but that she rejoiced at his
absence, as it would enable him to triumph over a passion she
could <i>not return</i>. Surprised at this declaration, I should have
been wanting to myself not to improve it. But love only can
give an idea of those pleasures we enjoyed in each other's
company with reciprocal tenderness. But <i>it</i> affords few sweets
that are not dashed with a mixture of bitterness. Happy
moments! how soon ye fled! a sad remembrance only of that
delightful interval left behind. Ah no, it is impossible I should
ever forget that day in which she first confessed those
sentiments for me my heart had long divined, the assurance
of which, nevertheless, gave me inexpressible transport. But
when I reflected on my friend, and that of my depressed
circumstances, it gave a sudden check to my joy. My sighs,
my tears, made known to her the distress of my heart! I could
only utter the name of <i>my friend</i>, and wrung my hands in
despair. She soothed my uneasiness. "This is the fatal stroke
I feared" said the gentle Adelaude; "this is what my
foreboding heart presaged. But your interest does not
interfere with his, for whom I never experienced any thing
more but that of a <i>sisterly affection</i>."</p>

<p>I then acquainted her with my dependent situation: that I
should be hurt at allying her so unsuitably, though had I had
the wealth of worlds it would have been hers. She told me her
estate was sufficient to enrich me: that the duke talked of
leaving Rotterdam; she dreaded being in the power of a man
so impetuous, who would stick at nothing to gratify his
passions; and that she would place herself under my
protection. Infatuated I was, not to comply with her request!
My friend's woes wounded me to the quick: false honor
determined me to write and inform him of the state of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
affair, previous to my taking advantage of her inclination for
me. I wrote instantly to the marquis; but a few days after the
duke set out for Italy with his family. The night before their
departure I saw the countess. "Thou must go," said I, "and
with thee all my joy, my happiness, my only hope&mdash;Go, and
take with thee all my heart holds dear, all that is left for me is
despair. Reason will resume its empire over love, and you will
forget a poor unfortunate, who hath nothing to offer but the
most pure and ardent affection; an affection in which consists
all the happiness of his life."</p>

<p>"Ah, my lord," said she, "forbear to speak a language so
injurious to your merit and my sentiments. Can I cease to
love you? Can I forget you? No! whilst my heart beats it will
be yours, and yours only&mdash;I will preserve myself for you, and
nothing can ever make me forgetful of the engagements I
have made with you."</p>

<p>The conflict of contending passions had tortured me so
much, that I confess, I was rather relieved, when they set out,
and when it was out of my power to have realized the
charming scheme the countess had suggested to me. What
forbearance did it not cost me? Nothing is more common
than for men to declaim against those things which they are
not in a capacity to enjoy: Diogenes said to Aristippus the
courtier, as he passed him in his tub, "If you could content
yourself, as I do, with <i>bread</i> and <i>garlic</i>, you would not be the
<i>slave</i> of the King of Syracuse:" "Are you," replied Aristippus,
"if you <i>knew</i> how to <i>live with princes</i>, you would not make such
<i>bad cheer</i>."</p>

<p>Perhaps the circumstances of age, health, and fortune, vary
the taste, and regulate the appetites of mankind more than
reason and reflection.</p>

<p>But everything conspired to render the sacrifice I had made
a <i>great one</i> to <i>friendship</i>. I soon received the following letter
from Julia.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="indent-2">
"My Lord,
</p>

<p>The countess is so closely watched, that she cannot write.
Would to God you had followed your inclinations! We are
going to Sweden: follow us, if possible, and repair the error<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
you have committed. I am fearful she will be constrained to
choose another husband. Adieu.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Julia</span> de <span class="smcap">Villeroi</span>."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Upon the receipt of this letter I went to Sweden; but could
hear no tidings of those I pursued. I became quite
melancholy, and seldom went abroad, but could not refuse
being introduced by the Baron de R&mdash;&mdash; to the Queen
Dowager, who is an exalted character: she is sister to the
reigning King of Prussia, is the avowed protectress of letters,
and encourager of merit: and during her husband's life
possessed an almost unlimited influence over affairs of state;
but at present leads a more retired and secluded life. She is
perfect mistress of Latin, as well as the modern languages.</p>

<p>The present King of Sweden at the age of twenty-six
changed the form of government, without blood or difficulty.
Sweden can boast of her two Gustavus's, the first and second;
nor are her Christina, or her Charles, unknown to fame. In
what country is not the name of Peter celebrated, the greatest
legislator that modern times have seen? Hearing no tidings of
the duke's family, I made out my northern tour. In Denmark
the sun of genius has not yet blazed from a throne, and shed
a temporary lustre on the surrounding darkness; if we except
the celebrated Margaret de Waldemar, to whom history has
given the epithet of the <i>Semiramis</i> of the north, who united
under her reign all the kingdoms beneath the polar sky,
Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. There are, however, two
favourite monarchs of Danish story. The first of these was
Christian IV, who was the opponent and competitor of
Gustavus Adolphus, but with far inferior fame. The last was
Frederic IV. This prince loved the arts, and made two visits
to Italy, one previous to his ascending the throne, and one
after it. During a carnival at Venice, he resided in that city,
and in one evening is said to have won, at the card-table, a
bank worth one hundred thousand pounds sterling, which he
immediately presented to a noble Venetian lady, in whose
house this happened, and whose whole fortunes were
involved in this game of chance: All the company were in
masque.</p>

<p>I cannot omit mentioning the literary merit of the ladies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Denmark; which has already been taken notice of by Lord
Molesworth, who says, that Tycho Brahe's sister, and
especially Dorothea Engelerechtie, may contend with the
famous poetesses of the ancients. The lady Brigetta Tot has
translated Seneca the philosopher into the Danish tongue,
with all the elegance any language is capable of, and has
conspired with our ingenious countrywoman Miss Carter<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>, to
shew that the most rugged philosophy of the stoics must
submit, when the fair-sex is pleased to conquer. But I forget
who I am writing to&mdash;Thanks to your extensive reading&mdash;I
have nothing to tell you that has been written and published
before. I shall only observe, that I met with many ingenious
men abroad who held the English cheap. I can account for
this in no other way, than that they form their judgment of us
only by the <i>philosophical transactions</i>. Absorbed in deep
melancholy, on account of my ignorance of the fate of
Countess de Sons, I went little into company, but applied
myself constantly to study: <a name="Dahl"></a>I amused myself in painting; the
cataract of the river Dahl is the subject of one of my pieces.
The tremendous roar of these cataracts, which, when close, is
superior to the loudest thunder; the vapours which rise
incessantly from them, and even obscure them from the eye
in many parts; the agitation of the river below for several
hundred yards before it resumes its former tranquillity; and
the sides covered with tall <a name="Corr27"></a>firs; form one of the most
picturesque and astonishing scenes to be beheld in nature's
volume.</p>

<p>Wrapt up one day in the contemplation of this scene, Lord
Ogilby whom I became acquainted with at Upsal, approached
me under an apparent agitation of spirits. We lived much
together, but I had observed him very absent, and missed him
several evenings. My Lord, said he, near this place resides all
that my soul holds dear: I am in love&mdash;in love, to a degree I
never felt till now. I am myself astonished at it. But blame me
not until you see the object of my affections. He said, that he
had been charmed with a young woman's figure and beauty,
and that she appeared to be possessed of the greatest
modesty, prudence, and good humour. He finished his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
panegyric with saying, <i>how happy will that man be who first
inspires her gentle heart with love</i>!</p>

<p>I accompanied Lord Ogilby (who remained silent) for
about a hundred yards, when we approached a cottage.</p>

<p>A window being opened, he said to me, There, my Lord,
you can see her without being observed. I looked, and beheld
a most exquisite Beauty. She was of a fair complexion, had
fine full blue languishing eyes, which sparked through the
long lashes of their beautiful lids, and expressed, with the
most innocent simplicity, all that an insipid coquet attempts
in vain. When she perceived we looked at her, it heightened
the vermilion on her cheeks, through the consciousness that
they betrayed the extreme sensibility of her heart; and if even
the rest of her person had not been equally engaging, yet the
bewitching sweetness of her countenance alone would have
intitled her to be ranked among the first class of pleasing
Beauties.&mdash;A beautiful boy of about two years of age, whose
hair flowed in natural ringlets like her own, was playing
beside her while she was making some artificial flowers. Her
dress was a brown camblet jacket and petticoat clasped at the
breast.</p>

<p>Upon perceiving us she arose, and received us with the
greatest politeness&mdash;It was easy for us to conceive she had
been accustomed to genteel life. She acquainted us that
whatever honor we might do her in condescending to come
into that poor cottage, yet she must for the future desire we
would not repeat our visit. As it was entirely contrary to her
plans, and to those views which determined her to retire to
that place. There appeared in her a timid bashfulness; but as
this seemed to proceed from the fear of <i>my friend</i>, who had
been importunate lover, and was a proof of the purity of her
heart instead of an awkwardness, it appeared a grace. Yes, I
repeat it, this bashfulness appeared in her quite engaging; for
as the shade in a beautiful picture, it served to set off the
masterly strokes of the piece. Lord Ogilby assured her in my
hearing, that he had no views but which were highly
honourable, that if she would give him her hand he would
make her his wife. "I am one of those, said he, who have ever
despised the common prejudices of mankind, particularly in
the affair of love. A fine person, a graceful carriage, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
amiable disposition, are all the titles or wealth I should look
for in a woman. You possess all these advantages, and to
them add the greatest delicacy of sentiment&mdash;so many
charms compensate for the want of those other qualifications
the injustice of fortune has deprived you of."&mdash;"Hymen, my
lord, answered she, can have no joys for me, and I am sure
will never light his torch on my account; for I have fountains
of tears which would soon extinguish it!" What was my
surprise to discover this beautiful girl (for her age did not
appear to exceed eighteen) so accomplished, that she could
read the Iliad of Homer, the Georgics of Virgil, the inimitable
Cervantes, and the plays of Terence, in the original
languages, with great ease! She was a <i>Hebe</i>, with the head of a
philosopher, the knowledge of a divine, accompanied with all
the exterior accomplishments the most finished education
could bestow. As we found her fond of reading, we carried
her a book of periodical papers then just written at Vienna.
The next time I saw her I inquired if she approved of it&mdash;she
replied she was no judge; but that she apprehended humour
in writing chiefly consists in an imitation of the foibles or
absurdities of mankind; so our pleasure in this species of
composition, arises from comparing the picture with the
original in nature, which she had no opportunity of doing.</p>

<p>In the works of our own countrymen we have frequent
opportunities of making this comparison, as the originals are
generally before us: But when we read the productions of
foreigners, as their portraits are copied from manners with
which we are not sufficiently acquainted, they must often
appear forced and unnatural. There is a cast of humour, as
well as of manners, peculiar to each country; and this is what
makes every nation give the preference to its own humorous
subjects. Nor is this preference ill founded, since the several
drawings are made from originals widely different from each
other; and as in portrait-painting, the value of the picture is
enhanced by our connections with the person who sat for it;
so here we must approve those pieces the originals of which
we are best acquainted with. The language of humour is also
in every country different from that used upon common
occasions, which makes foreign satire an exotic of too delicate
a nature to bear transplanting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>I was not surprised at my friend's situation; nothing I <i>then</i>
supposed could have secured my own heart from her
attractions but its being pre-engaged. All the great heroes,
the scripture worthies in particular, have had their <i>Delilah's</i>,
to whose bewitching charms they have <i>one and all yielded</i>;
reluctantly some, and fondly others; <i>these</i> proving their
wisdom, and <i>those</i> their folly; since <i>there is no enchantment
against beauty</i>, nor any thing it cannot enchant.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding my predilection in her favor, prudence
suggested to me that my friend's passion might hurry him
into an improper connection. I therefore inquired particularly
concerning this lovely woman. I found she had resided there
fifteen months, having brought with her a maid, and the child
whom we had seen: that soon after her arrival she had
disposed of some valuable effects; and that she had employed
herself since that period in making <a name="Corr28"></a>artificial flowers, which her
maid carried to&mdash;and disposed of them: that it was with
great pleasure they observed she was now much more
cheerful than she had been at first. That she was very regular
in her conduct; never saw any person, nor went abroad but
for divine service or a little air and exercise. This account
served only to increase my friend's passion. He left nothing
unsaid, nothing undone, to convince her of his sincerity; but
she remained inexorable! We were there one day; when I
took the liberty of remonstrating with her on this subject: She
was affected, and said, "My lord, you distress me greatly; but
at once to relieve myself <i>from your</i> friend's importunities, and
to prove <i>to you</i> how unavailable <i>his</i> pursuit <i>is</i>, I must be
reduced to the humiliating detail of <i>my sorrows</i>: then, pointing
to the lovely boy, she added, that cherub calls me <i>mother</i>,
although his cruel father has not given me the name <i>of wife</i>:
let this, my lord, render you unsolicitous concerning me."</p>

<p>Lord Ogilby, though struck at the intelligence, assured her,
that she was infinitely superior in his eyes to women of the
world, who vainly flatter themselves, that, while they appear
<i>not</i> to be conscious of their errors, mankind never discover
<i>their follies</i>! that he respected her candour, he would be a
father to her lovely boy, and, by his tender faithful
attachment, atone for her former disappointment. She said
every thing a sensible heart could feel on the sense she had of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the honor he did in addressing her on such honorable terms,
in the strange situation he found her in; but added, her heart
might break, but that in breaking it must be the entire
property of Sir Harry Bingley!</p>

<p>I am very sensible, my lords, continued Miss Harris, that
the foibles of those to whom we are indebted for our
existence, though open to the attack of all the world beside,
ought to be sacred to us. But it is incumbent on me to paint
my father's character, in order to inform you of the origin of
my misfortunes. He was the younger son of a family of
distinction, had received every advantage of education, and
had travelled all over the world; which he himself said had
divested him of many narrow prejudices! But this was not
sufficient for him&mdash;he must triumph over reason and nature.
He was too wise to adopt the opinions of his fore-fathers, yet
at the same time too indolent to establish any of his own; and
as he lived without system, he made present convenience the
rule of his conduct. His virtues consequently were <i>accidental</i>&mdash;but
his vices <i>habitual</i>. A clergyman that kept him
company countenanced <i>his errors</i>, and confirmed <i>my belief</i>,
that religious duties were only an <i>imposition on the vulgar</i>. I am
sure, my lord, you must agree with me in thinking that
<i>immorality</i> in a <i>clergyman</i> is as unpardonable as <i>cowardice</i> in a
<i>soldier</i>. <i>One</i> flies from the foes of his <i>king</i> and <i>country</i>; the <i>other</i>
justifies the <i>enemies of his God</i>. My father married a young
lady of large fortune. She had received a very religious
education, and had too much sensibility not to be exceedingly
wounded at his infidelity. He told her it was very well she
thought as <i>she did</i>&mdash;that all capacities cannot command a
sufficient degree of attention to pursue the intricacies of
philosophical speculation; neither if they could, are they
endowed with proper powers of perception to discern and
judge for themselves. As these must necessarily be governed
by prejudices, if you remove them, you leave such weak
objects without any principle <i>whatever</i>.</p>

<p>My mother answered, that the apostles were no <i>meta-physicians</i>:
nor did their blessed master teach them any thing
that should make them so. Wherefore she contented herself
with their plain instructions, finding much more satisfaction
from them than she did from any human writers, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
those who use so many and so nice distinctions, tending more
to <i>puzzle</i> than <i>enlighten</i> the understanding, and having little
effect upon the heart to make it better. It is to me, I own,
(said she) no recommendation of any cause, that the abettors
of it are obliged to have recourse to <i>abstruse terms</i>, and
especially when they introduce such terms into any system
that pretends to be Christian. I admire no scholastic phrases,
or terms of art, when applied to a doctrine which is matter of
revelation only; and wherein neither schools nor arts have any
thing to say further, nor can say any thing more clearly or
more certainly than what God hath said. I am far from
commending any imposition upon men's judgment, or any
dictating by one man what is to be believed by another! But
here my father interrupted her; and, in a passion, made use of
terms delicacy prevents a repetition of&mdash;adding, neither <i>man</i>
nor <i>woman</i> should dictate or make a fool of him! That
religion, etc. etc. varied in different countries, as he had often
observed something in the climate, soil, or situation of <i>each</i>,
which had great influence in establishing its particular mode
of superstition. Thus in Syria they worship the sun, moon,
and stars, as they live in a flat country, enjoying a constant
serenity of sky; and the origin and progress of that error may
be traced in a certain connection between those objects of
worship considered physically, and their characters as
divinities.</p>

<p>Thus the pomp and magnificence with which the sun is
worshipped in Syria, said he, and the human victims
sacrificed to him, seem altogether to mark an awful
reverence, paid rather to his power than to his beneficence, in
a country where the violence of his heat is destructive to
vegetation, as it is in many other respects very troublesome to
the inhabitants. Superstition, since the world began, has
consisted of every particular, which either people's <i>fears</i> or
their <i>follies</i>, either the <i>strength</i> of their <i>imagination</i>, or the
<i>weakness</i> of their <i>judgment</i>, or the <i>design</i> and <i>artifice</i> of their
<i>leaders</i>, taught them to <i>embrace</i>, in order to please any being,
or order of beings, superior to themselves, whom they made
the objects of their religious regards. My mother answered,
that the unbeliever changes nothing of the design of God,
when he dares to rise up against him&mdash;He ever enters into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
plan, where the evil concurs with the good, for the harmony
of <i>this</i> world, and the good of the <i>next</i>. I need not, my lords,
tire you with an account of these particulars, further than to
mark the difference of my parents characters&mdash;these arguments
recurring often, in the end produced such contentions,
that it impaired my mother's health&mdash;she died, and left me
under the guidance of a father, <i>totally unfit</i> for that <i>important
trust</i> He endeavoured to impress me with his sentiments of
religion, etc. If I imbibed his ideas, could I be blamed for it?
Is it not injurious and ridiculous to censure others for
thinking in the same manner we ourselves should have done
under the same circumstances? For if we do not consult our
reason (which in matters of religion is prohibited us) the
capacity and credulity of individuals are different, in
consequence of their diversity of temperament, education,
and experience. And it would be still more absurd to
reprobate the rest of mankind, for not believing what we
ourselves do <i>not</i>, nor can be made <i>to believe</i>. But to return to
my father: About a year after my mother's death, when I was
only eight years old, he set out for Italy, and returned home
inebriated with a love for antiquity&mdash;He could sit all day in
contemplation of a statue without a nose, and doated on the
decays with greater love than the self-loved Narcissus did on
his beauty. Sir Harry Bingley did me the honor to address
me; but my father, on his first proposal, would not hear of it;
he wished me to marry a brother antiquarian, who was
desirous, among other pieces of age and time, to have one
young face be seen to call him father. My lover told him, he
would pray to Heaven to have merit or deserve me&mdash;He
returned, "When your prayer is answered, renew your suit;
but if you stay till then, you must have spectacles to see her
beauty with." Had Sir Harry appeared to him like a Sibyl's
son, or with a face rugged as father Nilus is pictured on the
hangings, it would have been otherwise. But the qualities,
which recommended him <i>to me</i>, produced the contrary effect
on <i>my father</i><a name="Corr29"></a>.</p>

<p>Signor Crustino, whom he favored, had presented him with
books, that he said were written before the Punic war; and
some of Terence's hundred and fifty comedies that were lost
in the Adriatic sea, when he returned from banishment.&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>There
were powerful <a name="Corr30"></a>inducements&mdash;He commanded me to
marry him: I expostulated, but without effect. Had Sir Harry
Bingley been old in any thing, even in iniquity, I believe he
would have shown him some respect. Had he not, said he, the
indiscretion to betray weakness, even to myself? did not he
mention that his <i>old</i> rents produced one thousand a year; but
that he had made <i>new</i> leases, and doubled them; and by the
sale of a gallery of pictures had paid his father's debts? O
such preposterous folly! he values more his gold, than
whatever Apelles or Phidias have invented! "What is more
honorable than age?" said he: "Is not wisdom entailed on it?
It takes the pre-eminence in everything: antiquities are the
registers, the chronicles of the age, and speak the truth of
history better than a hundred of your printed commentaries!"
It was in vain I pleaded a contrary opinion; my tears had no
power to mollify his stony heart. I was ordered to prepare for
my wedding; which I was determined, at all events, should
not take place. In the mean time Sir Harry Bingley's passion
was increased by the difficulty of obtaining me, as the lovers
of the fair Danäe desired her more when she was locked up
in the brazen tower. He was importunate with me to elope:
inclination pressed hard on one side, duty on the other; I was
torn with contending passions: my distraction was increased
by the preparations for the marriage feast. My father took his
bill of fare out of Athenæus, and ordered the most surprizing
dishes imaginable. But I was reprieved by a most extraordinary
accident&mdash;He was possessed of a couple of old
manuscripts, said to have been found in a wall, and stored up
with the foundation: he supposed them the writing of some
prophetess&mdash;They were, he said, of the old Roman binding:
And though the characters were so imperfect, that time had
eaten out the letters, and the dust made a parenthesis betwixt
every syllable, yet he was inconsolable upon discovering he
had lost them; and suspected his brother antiquary of the
theft, <i>such</i> generally being very <i>adroit</i> on <i>pilfering</i>&mdash;Words
arose on the subject; they parted in wrath; my father
declaring the marriage should not be celebrated. Signor
Crustino next day wrote a mollifying letter, intreating his
acceptance of several other manuscripts, which he said were
dug out of the ruins of Aquileia, after it was sacked by Attila,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
King of the Hunns.&mdash;But he returned them with indignation,
and took to his bed, where he remained nine months in a very
lingering condition&mdash;then died&mdash;leaving me a prey to the
oppressive insolence of proud prosperity.&mdash;It is that only
which can inflict a wound on the ingenuous mind.&mdash;These
are the stings of poverty! Misfortunes never create respect:
dependence of course meets with many slights&mdash;On such
occasions, some show their <i>malice</i>, and are witty on our
<i>misfortunes</i>; others their judgment, by sage reflections on our
conduct; but few their charity.&mdash;They alone have a right to
censure, who have hearts to assist: the rest is cruelty, not
justice<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.</p>

<p>I found that my father's collection of curiosities, for which
he had expended all his fortune, did no more than pay his
debts. On this occasion all my acquaintances forsook me. A
rich aunt was the only person who recollected such a being
existed (my lover excepted). She afforded me help, but more
as if she had been giving <i>alms</i> to a <i>stranger</i>, than <i>relief</i> to a
relation. How few are acquainted with the art of conferring
favors in that happy manner that doubles the value of the
obligation! If in doing good, people consulted the circumstances
and inclinations of those they oblige&mdash;if, instead of
shocking their self-love, (inherent in us all) they knew how to
take advantage of it, with as much address as the flatterer
employs to gain his ends, the empire of morality would long
ago have extended its bounds, and the numbers of its
adherents would have greatly increased.&mdash;This is the more
easily done, as the <i>distressed</i> think any mark of attention
shown them by the <i>wealthy</i>, <i>a real favor</i>&mdash;But <i>neglect</i> in general
is the <i>portion</i> of the <i>necessitous</i>&mdash;and <i>outrage alone</i> employed to
recover <i>the guilty</i>.</p>

<p>Lord Ogilby could not help here, with some warmth,
asking where Sir Harry Bingley was all this time. Miss Harris
bowed, and resumed her story. "Alas!" said she, "the
Marquis of M&mdash;&mdash; his uncle, on whom he had considerable
expectations, insisted on his marrying Lady Ann<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Frivolité&mdash;and though he absolutely declined this overture,
he thought in prudence, he ought to defer for some time
entering into another engagement until he could bring his
uncle to hearken to it."</p>

<p>My necessities increasing, relying entirely on the honor of
my lover, I permitted him to conduct me to a seat he had in a
remote part of the country&mdash;It was a frightful dismal house
surrounded with yews and willows, whose different forms
recalled to my ideas Ovid's Metamorphoses, and made me
sometimes ready to bemoan the fate of unhappy lovers
converted into evergreens by the supposed enchantress of this
dreary mansion. The house had been long uninhabited: by
the blackness of the walls, the circular fires, vast cauldrons,
yawning mouths of ovens and furnaces, one would conclude,
it was either the forge of Vulcan, the cave of Polypheme, or
the temple of Moloch. The hangings of the apartments were
indeed the finest in the world; that is to say, which Arachne
spins from her own bowels. But the affection, the tender
respectful behaviour of my lover was <i>everything to me</i>. He said
he made no doubt but the marquis, when convinced of my
merit, would approve of his passion! Unwilling to see him
continue in so delusive an error, I told him there was little
probability of reviving the golden age in his family; or, hoping
that the benevolence of his own heart would become
epidemical, was an illusion! that relations or parents saw
things in a very different light from their children; as the
sentiment of the former arose from cool reflection, and as
those of the latter commonly resulted from the caprice of an
irregular imagination, or the violence of an impetuous
passion, which prompted them to act sometimes in direct
opposition to the salutary advice of their best friends.&mdash;He
replied, that granting that were even the case&mdash;the Marquis
of M&mdash;&mdash; could not live for ever&mdash;but that no power on
earth could induce him to sacrifice his happiness; that he had
a <i>competent</i>, though not <i>great</i> estate of his own&mdash;and would
marry me directly, if I chose it, or would take the most
solemn oath imaginable, to do it as soon as circumstances
rendered it prudent with safety. I consequently rejected
agreeing to his proposal: I could not bear the idea of my
lover's running the risk of losing a family inheritance on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
account; though a possibility of possession altering his
sentiments, never entered into my imagination. We remained
three months together, the happiest time of my life: Happy
moments, how soon you fled, never, never to return!</p>

<p>Miss Harris here blushed and stopped; we encouraged her
to proceed. With some hesitation, she added, At that time my
lover's importunity prevailed; I resigned myself to his wishes.
I had his solemn promise he would ratify our engagement at
the altar; and my father had instilled notions into me of
marriage being only a civil institution: he had often said, that
the marriages among the Israelites were not attended with any
religious ceremonies, except the prayers of the father of the
family, and the standers by, to beg the blessing of God. We
have examples of it in the marriage of Rebecca with Isaac, of
Ruth with Boaz. We do not read that God acted the part of a
priest to join Adam and Eve together, only that of a father to
the young woman, in giving her away&mdash;<i>For he brought her to
the man</i>: We do not see, he used to say, that there were any
sacrifices offered upon the occasion; that they went to the
temple, or sent to the priests. So that it was no more than a
civil contract. I also knew the present custom in Sicily and in
Holland. Thus I justified myself <i>to myself</i>, though not
effectually; but I was willing then <i>to believe</i> what I <i>wished</i>; as
no inconvenience <i>to myself</i> could equally affect me in its
consequences, as my lover losing his fortune on <i>my account</i>,
which made me decline marrying him at that time. And I
firmly relied on his honor, whom from that time I considered,
and shall do, as my husband. With this difference&mdash;if a
woman survives her husband, after some time set apart for
decency, there are many circumstances may combine to
render a second attachment eligible. But one who like me has
evinced a weakness must be more exemplary in every other
part of her character, and more tenacious in her conduct,
least the <i>particular affection</i> which occasioned <i>her error</i>, should
be imputed to her as a <i>depravity</i>. The event will prove, how
requisite it is, for the good of society, that certain rules
should be established, the infringers of which ought to suffer,
for the good of the community.</p>

<p>The effect of our passion was soon evident in my
person&mdash;but sorry I am to relate, grieved to repeat it&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
left me; and at a time when I expected every minute to
become a mother; without affording me one single line to
<i>comfort</i> or <i>relieve</i> my mind from a state of distraction, little
short of madness. I was at last told he had been obliged to set
out on confidential business to the continent! Alas, in what
way did I lose his confidence? His <i>glory</i> was dearer to me than
my <i>own life</i>; and had he told me of the circumstances, I
should have <i>urged</i> his <i>departure</i>, instead of wishing to <i>protract</i>
his stay.</p>

<p>I was in despair for his unkindness! Had my steps been
strewed with flowers, had I been possessed of every outward
accommodation wealth could bestow, alas, how unavailing
would all these advantages have been to me! but in my
situation, oppressed, afflicted, and surrounded with mortifications,
ignorant even of the means of my future support, and
that of his child, how dreadfully were my woes increased!
This mark of his inattention redoubled my grief. An
assortment of flowers, plants, etc. arrived after his departure,
which only served to remind me of the happiness I had
proposed myself from their cultivation in his company: but I
could not live by their scent, like a Dutch damsel, nor was I
descended of Cameleons that could be kept with air. In my
despair I refused all kind of nourishment; but a worthy girl
who lived with me, recovered me from this <i>reverie</i>. If you are
resolved, madam, (said she) never to eat a morsel more
during your existence, your behaviour at present is very
consistent; but if you design ever to do so, believe me that
this is the best time you can possibly do so for yourself,
exclusive of your child, who must suffer with you. The last
argument was a prevailing one&mdash;I enquired for food, and eat
greedily.</p>

<p>I was soon afterwards delivered of a lovely boy&mdash;I took him
in my arms&mdash;each feature depicted his beloved, though cruel
father! He has since been my only solace, comfort, and
happiness&mdash;were I hunted out of society, and were I to meet
with every species of abuse on <i>his account</i>, he would be
infinitely more interesting to me than all that the world could
confer upon me.</p>

<p>After two months, during which time I flattered myself I
should hear from Sir Harry, though my hopes proved too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
sanguine, I removed from his house&mdash;I cared not where I
went, if distant from a place he could discover me in, at a
time when his capricious passion might bring him back to me.
Many unfortunate women, in such a situation, give themselves
up (as Ariadne did) to Bacchus, from the day they are
deserted&mdash;But a superior education taught me better. My
maid's brother was a captain of a ship; I agreed with him to
bring us to this place. My child justified my keeping a few
valuable trinkets Sir Harry had given me, which I should
otherwise have returned&mdash;I set out, and, <a name="Corr31"></a>philosopher-like,
carried all my possessions about me. These trinkets, and
industry, have hitherto supported us&mdash;I revere virtue, though
I have unhappily swerved from the established rules of virtue
<i>in my country</i>&mdash;but I have the same warm affection for
virtuous people, the same tenderness for the unhappy, and
the same regard for those whom prosperity hath not blinded!</p>

<p>Lord Ogilby replied, Sir Harry Bingley must have been
nursed among rocks, and suckled by tigers, to have used you
thus! But you, even now, would prefer being the object of his
licentious passion, rather than to become my virtuous wife!
Miss Harris bowed, and replied, I flattered myself, my lord,
that I had, though not without great confusion to myself,
made you acquainted with my character&mdash;I therefore am
highly superior to the inference you have indelicately made. I
shall owe my future innocence to the sense I have of my
lover's perfidy; as the sore wound the viper gives, the viper
best cures. But my unfortunate circumstances exclude my
ever thinking of any other of the sex: All the rest of mankind
<i>are</i>, and must remain to me <i>a distinct species</i>. I would much
rather die a thousand deaths, than that my heart should have
once conceived such a thought! I have imprinted him in my
heart in such deep characters, that nothing can rase it out,
unless it rub my heart out. Although he has left me to be for
ever miserable&mdash;may he be blessed&mdash;and may the fair-one
whom he selects to be his happy, happy wife, love him the
hundredth part I did! In this cottage will I remain! here
dedicate my life to industry, to procure for the child of the
man I love, the means of food and education: and when the
great God calls upon me to offer up an account of all my
deeds, I <i>cannot</i>, <i>do not</i> believe, I shall be found very defective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
in what his justice will exact from me. Though I lament the
error I fell into, and am now convinced that we can have no
distinct notions of human happiness, without the previous
knowledge of the human constitution, of all its active and
perceptive powers, and their natural objects: therefore the
most natural method of proceeding in the science of morals,
is to begin with inquiring into our several natural determinations,
and the objects from whence our happiness can
arise.&mdash;This, my lord, I have carefully done&mdash;my resolution
is consequently fixed. Lord Ogilby again said, Madam, let me
still intreat you to consider&mdash;If you have any hopes of his
return, of all old debts, love, when it comes to be so, is paid
the most unwillingly; and all you get by your constancy, is the
loss of that beauty for <i>one lover</i>, which independent of my
proposal to you, would procure you the vows, sacrifice, and
service, of <i>a thousand</i>! She renewed her thanks for his
lordship's good opinion; added, she entertained no hopes
such as he had suggested, and must only beg leave to add,
before she concluded, after entreating we would conceal
his name, that it was not only a partiality for his person,
but admiration of his character, that must bind her for ever
his.</p>

<p>Lord Ogilby consigned a sum of money with her maid, that
in case indisposition should interfere with her plans, she
should still encounter no inconveniences.</p>

<p>I should not, my dear Aunt, have detained you so long with
this story, did I not know your friendship to Sir Harry
Bingley&mdash;I founded his sentiments, he is still fondly
attached to this lovely woman&mdash;Honor, and a responsible
situation, obliged him to leave her at the time, and his letters
miscarried by the sudden death of a friend he entrusted them
to. No part of my life, said he, can I recollect with so much
satisfaction, as that which I spent with my lovely wife, for <i>such</i>
I shall ever consider her. I reflect on the supposed injuries
she thinks she has received from me, and I lament I know not
<i>where she is</i> to make her every reparation in my power.
Immediately on my arrival, I went to the place where I had
left her&mdash;but no trace remained; she was fled, and had
carried along with her the fruit of our affection. I have been
fatigued with inquiries to no purpose&mdash;and conclude her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
dead; perhaps with grief for my supposed ingratitude.</p>

<p>Without letting Sir Harry know I was acquainted with his
story, I discovered every thing from him I wished; and had
the pleasure of hearing of his present independent fortunes,
which put it in his power to realize the truth of his
professions to Miss Harris. I sent off a courier to her&mdash;she is
now on her return to England.</p>

<p>But to return to my own affairs&mdash;I went to Italy, but could
hear no tidings of the Duke de Salis; was only informed, that
his son, after some irregularities inherent in youth, had made a
very good figure in the army, but for some time past had not
been heard of&mdash;Nor was it known to what place the duke
had retired. To amuse my chagrin, I went one evening to
masquerade at Venice, in the time of the carnival, and fell in
chat with a very agreeable young gentleman and his sister.
They politely hoped our acquaintance would not cease at the
end of the ball, and solicited a continuance of it&mdash;with this I
very cheerfully complied. I went&mdash;and am mortified to betray
my weakness to you; but truth obliges me to confess, that
notwithstanding the pre-engagement of my heart for the
Countess de Sons, yet I could not resist the attractions of
Mademoiselle de Querci: my passion for her commenced the
first moment I saw her; and her charming behaviour hourly
increased it. She was majestic in her appearance; and in her
were combined all the qualities that can make desirable the
woman I adore.</p>

<p>The more I saw her, the more was her empire confirmed
over me; but still dubious of the Countess's fate, and
conscious of my pre-engagement, honor kept me silent. I had
every reason to flatter myself my address would have been
acceptable, but my passion was subordinate to that sense of
honor my former obligations subjected me to. It is hard to
account for the motions of the human heart, or trace the little
springs that give rise to its affections&mdash;numberless latent
accidents contribute to raise or allay them, without our being
sensible of their secret influence. Thus situated, I came to
England at your request. The uncertainty of the Countess's
fate renders me wretched, while, to confess the truth,
Mademoiselle de Querci haunts my imagination. But <i>your</i>
felicity alleviates <i>my</i> uneasiness&mdash;as your joys or sorrows must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>

'My Dear Aunt,<br />
</p>

<p>This is a place I often wished to come to, but the peaceful
satisfaction I have had in your company makes me in vain find
it in your absence&mdash;everything I see, everything I hear, is so
contrary to reason, that, without diverting one's self of that
quality, it is impossible to be pleased with any thing, though
the novelty may engage one's attention at first. All here
appear to adopt the reigning ideas, and fashionable pursuits,
with as much pleasure as I feel in conforming to the
principles which your kind instructions and edifying example
have implanted in my mind. They do not, however, appear to
me to be happy, and, like comedians (who are not diverted
with the amusement they occasion) regret being condemned
to communicate a pleasure which they do not partake, and
lament not having received, from a different education, other
tastes, other talents, and other manners. I connect myself as
little as possible with them; as in epidemic distempers we are
only secure whilst we escape the touch of the contagious
person; and with respect to wounds of the mind, they are like
those of the body. These extravagancies I might, perhaps,
some months ago have considered in a less serious manner,
but the evident melancholy in which my brother is, shews me
the vanity of everything in this world&mdash;So handsome in his
person, so accomplished in his manners&mdash;possessing everything
the world places a value on&mdash;and yet too apparently
wretched. The Marquis of P&mdash;&mdash;, Lord Sombre, and his
other friends, endeavour in vain to rouse him out of his
<i>reveries</i>.&mdash;You are possessed of such philosophy, that you may
look upon this matter in another light; as for me, who have
<i>strong passions</i>, and that inseparable companion of them, <i>weak
reason</i>, I cannot help being seriously alarmed. My beloved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
brother has undoubtedly some secret cause of disquietude&mdash;he
sighs at times as if his heart would break! This affects me
very sensibly; I never was so unhappy in my life; besides, I
have not my dear Aunt to give a friendly check to my
extravagance of spirits, so am afraid of hazarding anything.&mdash;Every
person looks formally at me. When your
friend the Duchess of W&mdash;&mdash; introduced me to Lady
Charlotte Sombre, she said she pleased herself with thinking
what a harmony would arise between us; for in the character,
said she, I drew <i>of her</i> to you, she only sat <i>for yours</i>. Lady
Charlotte is very agreeable, lively, and entertaining. Lord
Sombre, I fancy, is what you would esteem a superior
character; he is noble, and has a soul; a thing questioned
much in most of the gay youths whom we converse with. He
appears to have fine feelings&mdash;I intend to be on my guard
before him&mdash;a man of true taste and delicacy prefers the
smile of the soul, to noisy mirth.</p>

<p>Lady Charlotte is addressed by Sir Alexander French&mdash;he
told her, his love would be eternal! That is, said she, neither
to have <i>beginning</i> nor <i>end</i>. Sir Alexander is a very great
coxcomb, she therefore gives him no encouragement; and
amused me with an account of him&mdash;her brother checked
her, and said there is an ostentation in these kind of
confidences, which he was mortified to observe in her&mdash;that
at least she should respect a man she had rendered unhappy,
and who had almost lost his reason on her account. She
replied, it were indeed a trifling sacrifice, were it even so, as
he had so little to part with, that it made the loss
inconsiderable&mdash;love, said she, never makes such a bustle in
hearts like his&mdash;his is a <i>laughing</i>, not a <i>melancholy</i> Cupid. She
has the charms of an angel, and dresses with the greatest
simplicity, regarding the colour and make of her cloaths,
rather than the quality.</p>

<p>When Lady Charlotte shewed me the <i>Arcadia</i> of my
mother's painting<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, all the tender passions were up in my
soul: I requested to be left alone, and bursting into tears, I
partly relieved the emotions of my heart&mdash;Lord Sombre
surprised me in this situation&mdash;I was too much agitated at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
first to return him an answer to some obliging things he said,
but at last made an apology for my weakness! His Lordship
told me, the sensibility I testified confirmed him in the high
ideas he entertained of my character. He then expatiated to
me on a subject very agreeable, <i>my mother's virtues</i>. That the
gentleman who educated him had been well acquainted with
her&mdash;who said, that good sense and genius were united in
her, and that by study, reflection, and application, she had
improved her talents in the happiest manner&mdash;having
acquired a superiority in thinking, speaking, writing, and
acting&mdash;and in manners, her behaviour, language, and
understanding, were inexpressibly charming.</p>

<p>The discourse of people here, my dear Aunt, appears to
me malicious; their civilities feigned; their confidences false;
and their friendships resemble a rose, which pricks the hand
of him who smells it. Every animal seeks its food, digs itself a
hole, or builds itself a nest&mdash;sleeps&mdash;and dies. It is a
melancholy reflection that the greatest part of mankind do <i>no
more</i>. The employment which distinguishes them most from
other animals, is the care of cloathing themselves, and their
enmity to each other&mdash;the first of these engages the attention
of millions of the younger people in this great city&mdash;while the
more aged employ themselves in the last. Although pride is
observable in a peacock and a horse, passion, in a tiger,
gluttony in a wolf, envy in a dog, laziness in a monkey, and
treachery in a cat, yet one does not find, in any animal
whatever, falseness to their own species.</p>

<p>A love of play, and building, are the characteristics of this
age&mdash;our sex imitates the other as far as they can in the
former&mdash;and having no <i>terra firma</i> for the latter, and not
contented with the ancient custom of castle-building, erect
fabrics on their heads three stores high. The rage of building
is so great, that nothing can check their ardour in it, although
it has been the ruin of many individuals; and there are at
present (it is said) fifteen hundred uninhabited houses in the
two parishes of Saint Mary-le-bone and Pancras. Though the
fortunes of most individuals are decreased in value by the rise
of the prices of provisions, and other articles of expense, yet
the houses, good enough twenty years ago, are now judged
inadequate. Among many other reasons alledged for this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
every woman of any tolerable fashion requires a room for her
wardrobe: what formerly could be kept in a chest, occupies
the space of a large apartment, as gowns (on account of their
trimmings) cannot be folded.</p>

<p>In short, my dear Aunt, all seem to walk in a vain show,
and the curls of <i>the head</i> are more attended to, than the
sensations of <i>the heart</i>.</p>

<p>I hope Mrs Dorothea Bingley is become more reasonable
than to wish to force my dear friend's inclination to marry a
man she detests. Don't you think, my dear aunt, that
marrying to increase love, is like gaming to become rich; they
only lose what little stock they had before.</p>

<p>My brother desires his respectful compliments to you, as I
beg mine may be acceptable to your Lord; and I ever am,
with the greatest esteem,</p>

My Dear Niece,<br />
</p>

<p>As in my present situation<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> I am interdicted from
writing&mdash;I shall only indulge myself in a few words to you.
The civilities you have received from all friends give me great
pleasure. Brought up in the lap of friendship, I am not
surprised, that upon your first emerging into the great world
you should feel the coldness of the common address of
strangers. It is possible those very accomplishments which
delighted your fond aunt and friends, <i>interested</i> for your
welfare, procure you the envy of <i>uninterested observers</i>. But if
any one denies you the praises your merit claims, betray not
any mortification at their want of candour, as your sensibility
would afford them a malicious pleasure.</p>

<p>I have ever made it a rule, before I vexed myself about
people's appearing to slight me, to consider the character of
the person, and to discover the motives of his acting; and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
very often found it was with no design to affront me, but that
the party was so humoursome as even to be insupportable <i>to
himself</i>. I have so long indulged myself in the society of a few
friends I love, that I am but ill suited for the world, as
anything unreasonable <i>vexes me</i>, and the want of sincerity
<i>offends me</i>. Mrs Dorothea Bingley continues to persecute her
niece on account of Mr Bennet! Nothing appears to me so
barbarous. I feel myself the happiest of women, and of wives,
and enjoy my felicity with a double <i>goût</i>, by reflecting upon
the restrictions I put on my inclinations for so many years.
And I am perfectly convinced, it is not until women have got
over their early years, that they can taste the delightful
pleasure of loving and being beloved. But no felicity is perfect
in this world, and I find my joy allayed from the observations
I made on your brother's apparent melancholy. To see you
and him happy, and properly allied, are circumstances I still
must look forward to with great anxiety. I am very apt to
believe man a much greater machine than he is generally
supposed to be. "Whoever (says Dr Johnson) shall inquire by
what motives he was determined on important occasions, will
find them such as his pride will scarcely suffer him to
confess; some sudden ardour of desire, some uncertain
glimpse of advantage, some petty competition, some inaccurate
conclusion, or some example implicitly reverenced."</p>

<p>Such are too often the causes of our resolves. Rousseau
says, if you would understand the men, study the women&mdash;I
myself think that it is difficult to know what a man's conduct
will be, until you are acquainted with his wife's character,
particularly when he enters into that connexion at an early
period of his life.</p>

<p>My best affections ever attend you and your brother, in
which my lord most sincerely joins.</p>

<p class="indent-2">
'Dear Madam,<br />
</p>

<p>Agreeable to your desire I write you a long letter in hopes
of making you laugh (for your letter to me gave me the
vapours, you appeared so serious, so unlike yourself)&mdash;it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
probable I may not effect my intention; but it will be a proof
to you of my affection. My aunt has been even rude to Sir
James Mordaunt, told him that he need not presume on my
partiality for him, that I had nothing to say in regard to
disposing of myself&mdash;that he must <i>treat with her</i>. He answered
her with some heat, that he had no idea of modern marriages,
where their lawyer is the priest that joins them; and the banns
of matrimony are the indentures, land and ring&mdash;That in
short he had no notion of treating for a wife as he would buy
stock of a broker&mdash;that if she chose to give me her fortune, it
<i>was well</i>&mdash;if not, we could live <i>without it</i>! lovers you know, my
dear Lady Eliza, are always philosophers!&mdash;Your fortune,
answered my good aunt, won't be a superfluous maintenance
for a family, and you shall not have a shilling of mine! Very
true, returned Sir James; but where content attends a
competency more is <i>unnecessary</i>.</p>

<p>I hope, said she, you are in the court party and may get a
pension? Sir James told her he was not; but if he were it
would be worse for him, as the principles by which the court
govern themselves are literally these: The man who has
trumpeted their merits for years, cannot on any provocation
assume an opposite character, without impeaching his
judgment and proving the instability of his attachment&mdash;Our
enemies it is wisdom to buy; but our friends will either be
firm in our cause from motives of interest, or silent sufferers
from motives of pride&mdash;Therefore, said he, good madam,
laughing, I mean to rise by being <i>in the opposition</i>&mdash;as most of
the great men have done before me! but, turning to me, said,
I never yet opened my mouth in that celebrated assembly, but
to give utterance to an occasional little monosyllable: But I
may improve in time.</p>

<p>My aunt detains Mr Bennet for hours together, as Aristæus
held Proteus to deliver oracles, judging I shall be charmed
with his learning and oratory; but I should like him infinitely
better if she would imitate Dulness, who kept the Muses in
the Dunciad to silence them. But for this eternal teazer's
<i>presence</i>, and your <i>absence</i>, (which by the by increased my
consequence) I should have enjoyed the races very much.
Mrs Damer, on whom nature has bestowed an understanding
greatly superior to her form, confesses you are handsome;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
whilst Miss Maydew, who has no other ambition than that of
attracting applause by the charms of her person, allows you
good sense. We seldom withhold the applause which is due to
virtues or accomplishments for which we cannot value
ourselves.</p>

<p>As to news, Mrs Trevors is parted with her husband: she
put the poor man out of all patience by her sameness of
character: If he made an observation, she assented; if he
altered his mind, she gave a nod. She was always the same
tune, the same object, that is to say <i>the same woman</i>. Perfectly
agreed, no <a name="Corr32"></a>quarrels indeed subsisted between them, but they
<i>fell asleep</i>. Water freezes only in stagnation. Indifference hung
over them like a cloud, and irksome passed the hours, which
might have flown with a swift pace, perhaps, had they been
passed with your humble servant.</p>

<p>The world would have been already laid in ruins if the
elements that compose it did not maintain it by their
discordant concord. If water did not resist fire by its coldness
and humidity it would have reduced all into ashes, and having
no further nutriment would have consumed itself. I will not
lose Sir James's heart from this cause. Diversity of opinions
shall quicken our conversation&mdash;Opposition shall not be
wanting on my part to cheer <i>his heart</i>, and make his time pass
<a name="Corr33"></a><i>agreeably</i>. An accommodating temper is all a man ought to
expect in a wife; more than this is disgusting&mdash;I am very apt
to believe that though a man of spirit would not suffer his
wife to dictate to him, yet he would as soon talk to a parrot, or
be the companion of a monkey, as of one who is his eccho on
<a name="Corr34"></a>every occasion. It is very possible with some men to be <i>too
good</i>. But there are no rules without exceptions; for was my
husband very perverse I would (follow the late example of the
<i>Premier</i><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> with the Opposition) revenge myself on him by
agreeing in opinion with him, which would oblige him to
commence hostilities with himself if he meant to <i>continue the
dispute</i>.</p>

<p>Our ancient neighbour Lady Ogle married the other day a
young ensign in the guards, although you know she has more
diseases than Galen ever wrote of&mdash;at every cough resigns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
some of her teeth, and every night screws off her leg&mdash;scarcely
has her own nose, and by the course of nature ought
to have kneeled in marble, or lifted up her arms in stone
twenty years ago. In apology for her conduct, she says, it was
merely to procure herself <i>a friend</i>. But as experience does not
coincide with her ladyship's expectations, I should marry Mr
Bennet, to <i>get rid of him</i>, were it not for my penchant
<i>elsewhere</i>. I look upon all these romantic notions of Platonic,
or spiritual love, as highly ridiculous. Our passions were
bestowed on us for wise purposes. When precepts of virtue
are strained too high, they are either impracticable or become
vicious in their consequences.</p>

<p>The captain, <i>her friend</i>, is contriving a <i>visto</i> through some
<i>woods</i> on <i>her estate</i>, to pay <i>his debts</i>; she tells every body,
however, that he is not only possessed of <i>all the graces</i>, but an
independant fortune. The next heir to the estate happens to
be of a different opinion&mdash;his picture of captain Plume is <i>all
shade</i>, hers <i>all light</i>. The former awkwardly imitates the style
of Rembrandt, and with a dark pencil loves to describe
hideous wrinkles and deformed features&mdash;but the latter
artfully copies the taste of Titian, and brightens the canvas
with all the lively glow of colouring. Perhaps if light and
shade were properly blended together, we might behold a real
likeness.&mdash;I don't like him. I mistake much if he is not
conceited&mdash;you know I pretend a little to be a physiognomist
as well as a botanist. In the natural world the external form of
plants afford us a hint for a conjecture of their virtues. Almost
all the plants of the same kinds are of the same virtues. The
poisonous plants, natives of our soil, are hardly a dozen, and
these are characterized even to the eye by something singular
or dismal in the aspect.</p>

<p>When I wrote you I was jealous of Sir James's attentions to
Miss Ords, I did not wish to be understood <i>au piè du
lettre</i>&mdash;She has a vacant countenance, her youth only renders
her <i>passable</i>. Her wit is not picquante, nor her manners
alluring. She can answer <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i>, with tolerable success,
nay sometimes hazards further: and when she goes to a
comedy does not intreat the company to instruct her <i>when</i> she
should laugh. Her father lives <i>en Prince</i>: like Lucullus, he
<i>plundered all Asia</i> to assist him <i>in house-keeping</i>. Sir James was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
very lively in his usual way&mdash;She said she did not like puns,
and had never made one in her life&mdash;I could not help
answering&mdash;It's my opinion <i>you never will</i>.</p>

<p>You ask me if I have got no more lovers? To talk
ingenuously with you&mdash;no; I know not what further inconveniences
such an acquisition might put me to: and as it might
probably happen (not on <i>my account</i>, but for my <i>aunt's acres</i>) I
have whispered my passion for Sir James Mordaunt as a
secret to Mrs M&mdash;&mdash;; so you need not doubt but it has
spread. She is an antiquated virgin, who endeavours to make
chastity atone for the want of every other virtue. She wanted
me sadly to ask her some question; I mortified my own
curiosity, to punish her propensity to detraction.</p>

<p>Lady Dun is at last expired, notwithstanding the prayers of
the faithful. Had she lived any longer, her <i>piety</i> must have
ruined <i>her family</i> by her total want of economy, as she did the
reputation of her neighbours by scandal.</p>

<p>I met the following story lately in an old book; the writer
appears to have been a person of great judgment, and not in
<i>the least</i> given to credulity. He relates, that a certain man who
had a wife that made this world his purgatory (though,
according to the <i>common acceptation</i>, she was <i>virtuous</i> and
prudent) happening to die some little time after her, he went
to paradise, as soon as the breath was out of his body, as a
reward for his patience in this world; being come to the gate,
he knocks, the good man St Peter opens the door, and desires
him very civilly to walk in, and take what seat in heaven he
pleased. The husband stopped a moment to recollect himself;
and then asks St Peter, Whether or not his wife was there?
The good Saint answered in the affirmative: upon which the
honest man, without staying for any thing further, takes to his
heels and makes for the road to hell; rather choosing to
renounce heaven, than be in the same place with his dear rib,
whom he was well assured would, out of the abundance of
her virtue, make heaven as great a hell to him, as she had
done this earth.</p>

<p>I must now, my dear friend, tell you what sincerely grieves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
me. My brother equals <i>yours</i> in melancholy: before he went
abroad, no man whatever had better spirits; but now,
although he does not complain of any particular disorder, yet
is he always indisposed&mdash;ever wretched, constantly sighing
and lamenting. This affects my spirits much: "<i>my heart is not
of that rock, nor my soul careless as that sea, which lifts its blue
waves to every blast, and rolls beneath the storm!</i>" But truth
obliges me to confess that I cannot go on with my admired
poet as&mdash;"<i>The virgins</i> have not as yet <i>beheld me silent in the
hall</i>!" No, no no, it is not come to that yet! I relieve you from

<p class="indent-2">
'My dear Harriot,
</p>

<p>Many thanks for your agreeable letter, your <i>gaieté de coeur</i>
always pleases me, <i>Vive la bagatelle!</i></p>

<p>But, my dear friend, I am uneasy at your aunt's persisting
in her persecution of you on Mr Bennet's account. He seems
to me to be a person rather created to fill up a vacuum in
nature, than to perform any active good in it. His want of
sensibility is sufficient to prepossess me against him&mdash;There
are in the occurrences of a married life so many trials of a
man's humanity that he whose want of tenderness might pass
unobserved had he continued single&mdash;must often appear a
very monster considered as a husband. May you be blessed in
that state with the man of your heart! I agree with you that
opposition, carried on without violence, gives a dignity to
our condescension; but we must not carry this too far or we
may counteract our design of preserving the heart we have
gained.</p>

<p>To manage men requires more dexterity than to win them,
as the consequence of most <i>love matches</i> evinces.</p>

<p>You ask a thousand questions, having never been in
London yourself, on account of your aunt's apprehensions of
a disease she had not the resolution of giving you at an early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
period of life<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. I told you that you must not expect any
characters from me, as I was always an enemy to detraction,
and few there are that merit commendation. Let us, my dear
friend, regulate our <i>own conduct</i>, rather than condemn that <i>of
others</i>: but as I cannot refuse you anything you ask (though I
may wonder at your asking) I will suppose we are chatting
over a dish of tea, and giving our opinion of a gown or a cap,
and will tell you who suits my taste, or who my reason
contemns, with as little meaning as if I talked of the gown and
not the woman: and this I the more readily do, as I know you
will not betray the confidence I place in you.</p>

<p>The truth is, however, I am perfectly astonished at the
strange characters this town abounds with; and stupified (<i>if I
may</i> be allowed the expression) with what I have heard: but,
as Shakespeare allows Desdemona to speak after she was
smothered, you will permit me to write though I have lost my
understanding. And as it was the choice of certain great men
to be intelligible, it is probable my present state of mind will
lead me to imitate them. But on second thoughts, my being
not <i>au fait</i> to the subject may perhaps make me excel in it.
Men often expatiate <i>best</i> on what they <i>least understand</i>, by the
same rule that people in general are contrary to what they
would seem.</p>

<p>The Mantuan Swain lived constantly at court: Horace
wrote in celebration of a country life when he resided in
Rome: and it is well known travels, voyages, etc. to every part
of the world have been written in London. Why should I not
then, Eliza Finlay Spinster, attempt delineating manners,
which I have really seen? My scruples would intrude&mdash;that
perhaps I am not sufficiently informed, as I have only resided
here a month; but these vanish on the recollection that I must
certainly be in the right in the above position&mdash;Otherwise,
could it be possible for Mr Blacklock<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>, a poet blind from his
birth, to describe visible objects with more spirit and justness,
than others blessed with the most perfect sight? Could certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
orators, famous for their <i>extravagance</i>, harangue on <i>economy</i>&mdash;Or
the learned at Venice employ father Piaggi to copy the
manuscript found at Herculaneum (though he is unacquainted
with Greek, the language they are written in)&mdash;Or could
our own countrymen, the <i>learned</i>, <i>judicious</i> body in Warwick-lane,
refuse to admit to be their associates in the science of
<i>Æsculapius</i>, any but those who have studied where&mdash;<i>medicine
is not taught</i>? After such precedents as these, it is clear I
cannot err, in informing you of what&mdash;<i>I know little about</i>.
Besides, it is an established rule of prudence, on the contrary,
never to commit yourself by talking or writing on a subject the
world gives you the credit of understanding, as you have
<i>nothing</i> to <i>gain</i> but <i>much</i> to <i>lose</i>. This consideration no doubt
induced one author<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> to omit in his tragedy <i>morality</i>, which
should be the ground-work of every fable, and deterred
another<a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> from acknowledging providence, though it so
eminently presided, and was so conspicuously displayed in
the miraculous escapes made in the voyages he wrote of. This
being premised, I will now begin boldly to <i>relate</i> many things I
cannot <i>comprehend</i>.</p>

<p><i>Miss Ton</i> accompanied me to the opera; I was amazed at
the height of her head, and how her chair had failed to crush
the fabric of feathers and frivolity which rose above each
other! I could not think she had flown, though she was
composed of cork and feather; and willing to be informed
how she had managed it (as ignorance, you know, is
reprehensible) I ventured to ask her the question. She
returned me a look of contempt (as if to pity my ignorance)
saying, she always took care to prevent a misfortune of that
kind! When I go to court, said she, as heads are wore lower<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
there&mdash;I fit like your old woman upon the seat of the chair,
which is convenient enough on account of one's trimmings,
but when I go to the opera, where <i>fancy directs</i> and <i>fashion
prevails</i>, I say my prayers the whole way&mdash;that is to say, I
kneel <i>on the bottom of the chair</i>. I admired her ingenuity; only
observed, I hoped it did not fatigue her knees so much as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
prevent her from going to church next day! O, not in the
least, said she; but I always go to the drawing-room of a
Sunday! except when I go to the Chapel-royal&mdash;<i>the closet
there</i>, indeed, that is no bad public place&mdash;nobody but people
of fashion are admitted, and it is really sometimes very
amusing! The truth is, if one liked church very much, there is
time enough to dress afterwards; for it is not <i>the rage</i> which a
certain set to go to the drawing-room until your old-fashioned
people are coming away. Oh the dear delight of
meeting these dowdies on their <i>retour</i> home to their spouses
and family dinners at <i>four o'clock</i>. Then we make such
glorious confusion! I took the liberty of saying that I thought
the respect due to their Majesties had induced every body to
be in the drawing-room previous to their appearance! Oh, not
at all, child, said she&mdash;except your <i>formal ones</i>! But why, said
I, madam, need you go to court of a Sunday, why not of a
Thursday as well? Of a Thursday! Nobody goes of a
Thursday! Pardon me, replied I, the Duchess of W&mdash;&mdash;
introduced me on that day! That may be, replied Miss <i>Ton</i>,
her Grace is very old, wrinkles make her religious&mdash;but none
but such, or courtiers, go of a Thursday! I again took the
liberty of telling her that it had also been a very full drawing-room&mdash;Then,
said she, it must have been the Thursday
after the birthday&mdash;or some particular day; for otherwise few
of a certain set, who understand <i>the rage</i>, would go. The <i>rage</i>,
said I, madam! I am again at a loss; did I hear you right? O,
perfectly well, said she; the <i>ton</i>, was formerly the word, but
<i>the rage</i>, has lately been adopted from the French! (It is to be
hoped, that the Parisians will also, from their late partiality for
<i>English Gauzes</i>, <i>Silks</i>, <i>Linens</i>, <i>etc.</i> induce us to adopt <i>them also</i>,
instead of too often procuring these articles from France.)</p>

<p>Forgetful of the imprudence I was going to commit&mdash;I
told Miss <i>Ton</i> her prayers had proved ineffectual&mdash;her largest
feather was snapped in two. Is it possible! exclaimed she, and
reddened prodigiously.&mdash;Shocked at the blunder I had made,
and pitying her weakness, I gave her my bottle of Eau de
Luce; and not caring to hazard any further on so interesting a
subject, lest it should hurt her nerves, I turned the
conversation to what was more indifferent&mdash;a sister of her's,
who <i>had died in child-bed a fortnight before</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>(This, my dear friend&mdash;to philosophise&mdash;no abstract evil
exists; for whatever calamities human life is subject to, their
evil depends merely on our own sensibility.)</p>

<p>Sir Timothy Clinquant rejoined us. He is handsome, has a
good opinion of himself, and is no stranger to the art of
flattery. She lamented to him the accident of her feather.
From a knowledge of human nature, that nothing pleases so
much as to have a defect of any kind turned into a
beauty&mdash;he assured her the feather being broke gave it an
air of negligence so perfectly adapted to the <i>contour</i> of her
fine face, that he could not be convinced, but that she
<i>accidentally</i> on <i>purpose</i> afforded it <i>that grace</i>. Thus was she
restored to good-humour.&mdash;I can tell you little of what I saw;
Miss Ton's head intercepted my view of the stage: <i>her rage</i> of
going late having prevented our getting any other but end
seats, and she sat before me. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth
there was a law made to restrict the growth of ruffs: I wish
our legislators,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> who, in this accommodating age, do
sometimes condescend to bestow their attention on trifles,
would take the size of heads into their consideration. Mr
Walpole observes, in his anecdotes of painting in England,
that in the reign of the two first Edwards, the ladies erected
such pyramids on their heads that the face became the center
of the body.</p>

<p>An eminent physician has declared, that more deformed
children have been brought into the world this last year than
for twenty years before, on account of the ladies stooping in
their carriages&mdash;One thing I am certain of&mdash;it makes them
contract a habit of frowning, that furrows their foreheads.</p>

<p>A fine lady is the least part of herself, and is every morning
put together like some instrument. Dress is the subject
eternally discussed. Gulliver tells us, that the sages of Laputa,
having substituted things in place of words, carried along with
them such things as were necessary to express the particular
business they intended to discourse on.&mdash;Were this the case,
it would be a great relief; but alas! they do no more here than
propose the subject. But to return to the opera&mdash;Miss <i>Ton</i>, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
telling me who the people were, said they were <i>horrid creatures</i>,
that is to say, censorious or <i>awkward</i>, because <i>not of her
particular set</i>.</p>

<p>But what was my surprise to perceive her familiarly
afterwards whispering to one, curtsying to another, telling a
third how unfortunate she had been in not being at home
when she did her the honor of calling on her! I could not help
testifying my astonishment at her conduct!&mdash;She laughed,
and said&mdash;I am civil to those people, as the Indians worship
the devil&mdash;<i>for fear</i>. Besides, said she, the last Lady has a rich
brother lately come from India. In days of yore women
married for a title, a fine seat, etc.&mdash;A title is very agreeable,
but a <i>fine seat</i>, the very idea of it gives me the vapours! I
would rather marry a London justice than a lord lieutenant of
the county. It did very well formerly (when people were so
dull as to be able to bear their own thoughts) to live moping
at an old family place; but manners are <i>now</i> too much
improved for <i>that</i>: and a nabob's cash, without the appendages
of the seats of his ancestors, will suffice to carry me one
season to Spa, another to Tunbridge, etc. etc.&mdash;In marrying a
nabob, there is a moral security of never being buried in the
country. I am no <i>devot</i>, but I believe there is such a thing as
conscience; and, as few of these continental heroes can bear
to listen to their silent monitor&mdash;it induces them to lead
<i>exactly the kind of life I like</i>&mdash;to <i>exclude reflection</i>!</p>

<p>I answered, that she was too severe; I made no doubt but
that a man may get rich across the Atlantic, without wounding
his honor, and all the finer feelings of humanity by peculation
and extortion, which leaves the possessors more wretched
than pale-eyed poverty with all its whole train of meagre
haunts. To change the conversation, I said, so madam, I find
you intend to marry. Yes, said she, <i>to be sure</i>&mdash;But I hope in
god I shall have no children to <i>spoil my shape</i>. I cannot here
refrain from telling you a circumstance I saw occur myself.
We dined at Lady &mdash;&mdash;'s; I observed a lady change
colour&mdash;Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; whispered to her, that ladies in her
situation (for she appeared with child) were apt to be
<i>indisposed</i>. She seemed hurt at the supposition, and denied
any thing was the matter with her! As by the conversation it
appeared she had <i>already had children</i>, I was at a loss to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
account for <i>her conduct</i>. Colonel H&mdash;&mdash;, her husband,
appeared very uneasy&mdash;an inquisitive look of kindness, a
tender affectionate concern, were strongly depicted on his
manly countenance&mdash;his anxiety appeared to me to proceed
from that fond attachment arising from loving another better
than one's self. I entered into his ideas, contemplated her
happiness, and as he is not a very young (though agreeable)
man, the apparent attention he paid her confirmed me in
what you know was always my sentiments, that <i>such</i> make the
<i>best husbands</i>. Desirous of relieving his anxiety by contributing
to her ease, I begged she would permit me to accompany her
to another apartment. As her uneasiness had greatly
increased&mdash;she was under a necessity of accepting my
offer&mdash;and fainted as soon as she got into Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s
library. The alarmed and fond husband followed, who
intreated a maid might be called to cut the lacing of her stays.
He was much affected, and, addressing Lady Charlotte
Sombre and me, said, There, young ladies, lies a victim of the
fashion! Before I brought her to this town&mdash;she was the
delighted mother of three fine children&mdash;but these fond
sensations are now lost in the trifling consideration of a <i>fine
shape</i>; and though in the last month of her pregnancy, she has
a vanity in flattering herself she cannot be thought in <i>that
situation</i>! The lady was carried home, and we heard next day
she had been delivered of a <i>still-born child</i>.</p>

<p>Lord Spangle asked Miss <i>Ton</i>, how soon she got to bed the
other morning? Not, my Lord, until eight&mdash;you know we did
not sit down to dinner until twelve at night. Not until twelve
at night! said I. No, returned she; you know nobody dines till
after the opera: it was <i>Danzi's</i> benefit; all the world were
there, and there were many songs <i>encored</i>.&mdash;Dinner was
ordered by eleven; but Lady Peccedillo was not at the
opera&mdash;her monkey died, and she had not nerves for seeing
Lord &mdash;&mdash; who is always there, and who she esteems the
direct image of her dead favourite. Her hair-dresser was
ordered at ten, but disappointed her&mdash;and dinner was
retarded on her account. Pray, said I, at what time did you
sup? Why, we sat down to cards at two o'clock, played until
six, then went to supper, and parted half an hour after seven!
I find, said I, that the people of the <i>ton</i> reckon the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
according to the <i>Mosaic</i> custom, where the evening and the
morning make the day. But pray, madam, what becomes of
your servants all this time? I hope you only appoint them to
attend you home? Servants! Lord, Madam, nobody thinks of
their servants! I do not see myself what business servants
have to sleep <i>at all</i>! I can do very well with three hours sleep,
and I expect next winter to bring myself to two!<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>You say that lady and Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; have been lately abused,
even by their own friends, that is to say&mdash;those they
associated most with&mdash;Would you know the reason? My dear
friend, they have left off play, at which they generally lost
considerably. The first of these ladies, from unavoidable
misfortunes, altered her plans in life: the last, from a different
cause&mdash;Her family remonstrated, her husband frowned; but
they remonstrated, and he frowned to <i>no purpose</i>! Her luck
turned, her passion increased for that dangerous amusement,
yet she took a resolution, and would <i>play no more</i>.&mdash;She who
was before set down as an agreeable acquaintance, was now
deemed capricious, and the eyes of her card-playing
acquaintances, who were before <i>blind</i> to her <i>real imperfections</i>,
became now <i>scrupulously attentive</i> to her <i>imaginary errors</i>.
Many various conjectures were formed for the reasons of her
conduct&mdash;many allegations made that she had formed <i>an
attachment</i>, or was deterred by <i>spouses's directions</i>! To clear her
at once from these imputations, neither of which (be they
<i>crimes or virtues</i>) she has a mind capable of&mdash;The truth
is&mdash;she has beautiful teeth&mdash;and accidentally read Mr
Tolver's book, where he considers the passions as internal
causes of their diseases.</p>

<p><i>Errors</i> proceeding from the <i>sensations of the heart</i>, are not
<i>those</i> of this age. I was told there had been a long attachment
between Lady &mdash;&mdash; and Colonel &mdash;&mdash;. I deplored, I
pitied her! He is now abroad in a dangerous situation! What
anxiety, what wretchedness must she not suffer! How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
surprised I was to find&mdash;she never misses <i>a public place</i>. The
Duchess of W&mdash;&mdash; was much amused at my simplicity&mdash;Formerly
(said she) if a woman had the misfortune <i>to love
where</i> she could not avow it&mdash;decency induced her carefully
to conceal her weakness&mdash;but now it is <i>quite otherwise</i>&mdash;The
soft sensations find no admittance into their sophisticated
hearts&mdash;though they have no objection to a man of fashion <i>in
their train</i>.&mdash;And a certain set of <i>the ton</i>, or <i>the rage</i> go so far
as even studiously to afford an appearance <i>of what</i> in reality
never entered into <i>their imaginations</i>!</p>

<p>I think I hear you say, how strange! But everything is so I
think in this place. I met Lady Bab Cork-rump the other day:
My dear Lady Eliza, said she, I love a comedy of all things;
pray let us go to one soon. I am disengaged next
Thursday&mdash;That is very lucky, returned I; I have <i>a box that
evening: it is our favourite play</i>; and <i>Mrs Abington acts</i>!&mdash;That is
<i>delightful</i>, said she! And, added I, it is a charity play for the
dispensary of the infant poor&mdash;upwards of twenty-six
thousand children have been relieved by this humane
institution since its commencement nine years ago. Lady Bab
heard the above impatiently.&mdash;It is a charity play, you say,
madam!&mdash;I don't know, I believe my brother expects some
friends from the country. I suppose it will be no disappointment
to your ladyship if I <i>don't go</i>?&mdash;O, not in the least, said
I&mdash;Thus the idea of <i>Charity</i> makes a fine lady shrink (as if it
were contagious) into herself, and prevented Lady Bab from
going to a place her inclination otherwise induced her to.</p>

<p>Lady Bab seems to have a great partiality for Sir Hugh, our
neighbour&mdash;Since he got his fortune&mdash;his riots are generosity&mdash;carelessness,
the freedom of his soul&mdash;his prodigalities,
an easiness of mind proportioned to his estate. He
quarrelled the other day with Captain Essence on her
account; and I was alarmed to the greatest degree for the
consequences! she laughed at my fears, assuring me there
was no kind of danger in what I apprehended. The
gentlemen, said she, have renounced the conduct of heroes.
The custom of wagers is the happy succedaneum, and
prevents much blood-shed. Thus matters of dispute are left
in <i>tranquil doubt</i>, until the period arrives for <i>its</i> no less <i>tranquil
decision</i>. It turned out as she said; Captain Essence wagered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
with Sir Hugh, that <i>the new club in Saint James's Street would
be the ruin of Lord &mdash;&mdash;, before the old one vis-à-vis had knocked up
General &mdash;&mdash;</i>.</p>

<p>I have spent so much money on <i>bagatelles</i>, that I cannot
help regretting the expenditure of what if otherwise applied
might have produced such beneficial effects.&mdash;But if we
commit some follies, we are sufficiently kept in countenance
by the other sex. Modern story tells us the late King of
Poland was so much captivated with forty-eight china vases,
that he purchased them of the late King of Prussia at the
price of a <i>whole regiment of dragoons</i>.</p>

<p>You know, my dear friend, how many elogiums have been
bestowed on Lady Darnley, on account of the aids she
afforded for the disquisition of the particular genius's which
distinguished the young people, to prevent a misapplication of
the talents of the rising generation. "Is it not by a
misapplication of talents," said one, "that our present
mortifications arise? Many a man miscarrying in one
profession, would have succeeded happily in another. Hence
we see so many heads applied to what requires thinking,
which might have been applied to their country's good in the
manner of the ancient use of <i>battering rams</i>, and have been
run against stone walls <i>without the least danger of being
hurt</i>.&mdash;If the mechanic should invert all the principles which
compose the knowledge of that science; if he should assign
the wheels to be the principle of motion, the spring to run
round and be moved, the weight to vibrate and regulate, and
the pendulum to urge; would not all mankind deride such a
machine, because it could not perform its office? Is not this
the unhappy case of this country at present? have not our
enemies taken the advantage of it?"</p>

<p>But to leave politics&mdash;which I owe to the observations of an
old gentleman, who has too much reason to be chagrined
with the procrastination in the conduct of public affairs, as it
has affected the interest of his private family&mdash;I am most
sincerely concerned on account of your aunt's apparent
obstinacy in favour of Mr Bennet. Parents, imagining that
years <i>impart wisdom</i>, which have only <i>altered tastes</i>, are apt to
be arbitrary in their determinations, and dress in the furs,
which become the ice of old-age, the glowing blood of youth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
But do not, my dear friend, barter your happiness for
splendour. I suppose (but do not take my supposition for an
oracle) that it is not likely I shall every marry&mdash;If I do not, my
fortune shall be yours; being ever most affectionately</p>

From the Earl of Munster to the<br />
Countess of Darnley.
</p>
<p class="indent-2">
My dear Aunt,<br />
</p>

<p>Since I wrote you last, I walked one day in the city. A <i>black
man</i>, <i>well dressed</i>, fell down in the street: as none was near, I
run, took him in my arms, and carried him into a house of
refreshment, where I immediately procured him assistance.
Upon his recovery he acknowledged his obligations to me,
and said, that but for me he must have died:&mdash;and at the end
of the lottery of life, our last minutes, like benefit tickets left
in the wheel, rise in their valuation. I accompanied him home,
where I saw his wife; who, though as black as the collyed
night, is as ingenious, sensible, and agreeable a woman as can
be found among the daughters of England. He inquired of
her for a friend; who arriving, to my inexpressible surprise
proved to be the Marquis de Villeroy, but so emaciated that
the eye of friendship could not behold him without shedding
tears&mdash;he knew me at once, and ran to my embrace&mdash;This,
said he to the black gentleman, is Lord Munster, my friend,
the companion of my youth.</p>

<p>After the joy we mutually testified at meeting, I could not
help testifying my surprise at the alteration in his person! My
Lord, replied he, I will acquaint you with the most extraordinary
history that ever occurred to any one. Upon the receipt of your
letter, I made no doubt, in the first impulse of passion, but you
had betrayed me; I suddenly left the army, and travelled day
and night until I took shipping for Rotterdam. On my arrival
at that place, I found my father had left it; and was also informed
of the honorable part you had acted, and that I had falsely
flattered myself with the Countess's affection. I lamented your
misfortune and my impatience, as on reflection I was sensible
of the imprudence I had committed in leaving my post&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
was determined, however, not to lie under any imputation of
cowardice&mdash;I returned to&mdash;waited on the general officer&mdash;acquainted
him with the real truth, obtained forgiveness of
my fault, which was afterwards looked upon in a proper light,
as I had the good fortune to distinguish myself soon after in
two engagements. Upon our being ordered into winter-quarters,
I obtained leave of absence, and was resolved if
possible to discover to what place my father had retired; for
although my love was hopeless, I flattered myself still with
having it in my power to rescue the Countess de Sons from
his <i>tyranny</i>, and restore her <i>to you</i>.</p>

<p>My servant one day, with a face of joy, communicated to
me that he had learned my father lived at a house near
Marseilles. He heard this, he said, from a brother, who had
an intrigue with one of the Duchess's maids.&mdash;Is the duke
then married? said I.&mdash;Alas, my friend, said the Marquis, I
am sorry to inform you, the object of your affections fell a
victim to my father's designs&mdash;he compelled her to give him
her hand!&mdash;I found he had turned the Countess's fortune
into cash and jewels, on which he lived, being desirous of
concealing the place of his abode, jealous to the last degree of
her being seen! With this view all his servants <i>were females</i>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these precautions, his domestics talked of
his peculiarities; which occasioned interrogatories concerning
his funds of expense. These the inquirers soon discovered
were in specie in the house: this determined them to rob him.
My servant's brother, who was courting the Duchess's maid,
informed her <i>of me</i>; next day received a letter from my sister,
who promised to admit me one night into the house, where
she directed me to come in disguise with my servant!&mdash;Thus
was I made a tool of by these ruffians: they meant to effect
the robbery by <i>my means</i>; and if detected, flattered themselves
they would be pardoned <i>on my account</i>! At the time appointed
I went; Julia let me in, leaving the door open for my servant.
She was beginning to inform me of all their distresses, when
our ears were assaulted by an alarm-bell!&mdash;in an instant the
house was filled with people; I heard my father say, Where is
the rascal who calls himself my son? My servant, upon being
discovered, had informed him, that I had hired him and his
three companions (whom he had introduced into the house)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to murder and rob him, and to carry off the ladies! It was in
vain I assured him to the contrary; he would not hearken to
me; he recollected how much I had been in love with his
charming ward; he upbraided me with my wickedness, and
perhaps did believe me guilty.</p>

<p>This affair, I make no doubt, has been misrepresented in
the world&mdash;we have no true histories, but such as have been
written by those who were sincere enough to relate what they
experienced, in what relates to themselves.</p>

<p>I was seized, and carried to a dungeon until my trial; when,
without a hearing, I was condemned for life to be a galley-slave,
and sent for that purpose on board the gallies at
Marseilles. The labour of a <i>galley-slave</i>, is become a proverb;
nor is it without reason that this may be reckoned the greatest
fatigue that can be inflicted on wretchedness.</p>

<p>Imagine six men chained to their seats, entirely naked as
when born, sitting with one foot on a block of timber fixed to
the footstool; the other lifted up against the bench before
them, holding in their hands an oar of an enormous size.
Imagine them lengthening their bodies, their arms stretched
out to push the oar over the backs of those before them; who
are also themselves in a similar attitude. Having thus
advanced their oar, they raise that end which they hold in
their hands, to plunge the opposite in the sea; which done,
they throw themselves back upon their benches below, which
are somewhat hollowed to receive them. But none but those
who have seen them labour can conceive how much they
endure: none but such could be persuaded that human
strength could sustain the fatigue which they undergo for an
hour successively. But what cannot necessity and cruelty
make men do? Almost impossibilities. Certainly no galley can
be navigated in any other way, than by a crew of slaves, over
whom a <i>comite</i> may exercise the most unbounded authority.
No free man could continue at the oar an hour unwearied:
yet a slave must sometimes lengthen out his toil for ten,
twelve, nay, for twenty hours, without the smallest intermission.
On these occasions the <i>comites</i>, or some of the other
mariners, put into the mouths of those wretches a bit of bread
steeped in wine, to prevent their fainting through excess of
fatigue or hunger, while their hands are employed upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
oar. At such times are heard nothing but horrid blasphemies,
loud bursts of despair, or ejaculations to Heaven; all the
slaves streaming with blood, while their unpitying taskmasters
mix oaths and threats, and the smacking of whips, to
fill up this dreadful harmony.</p>

<p>At this time the captain roars to the <i>comite</i> to redouble his
blows; and when any one drops from his oar in a swoon,
(which not unfrequently happens) he is whipped while any
remains of life appear, and then thrown into the sea, without
any farther ceremony. The <i>Diable Boitteux</i>, in order to make
<i>Cleofas</i> sensible of the happy condition of an inquisitor, tells
him, Was not I a Dæmon, I would be an inquisitor? Were the
devil to become a mortal, he would incline to be the <i>comite</i> to
the galley-slaves at Marseilles, whose hearts are inlapidated
by cruelty.</p>

<p>How these slaves are fed, to enable them to support such
enormous toil, may be judged from the following account.&mdash;When
it was necessary we should take some refreshment, the
captain ordered <i>the dogs to their mess</i>. He only meant by this,
that we should be served with beans, the usual food allowed
us. These are indeed most intolerable eating, and what
nothing but the most pinching hunger could dispense with.
They are ill boiled, with scarce any oil, a little salt, and all to
be eaten out of a capacious cauldron, not the cleanest in the
world, as may easily be conceived.</p>

<p>I was never so hungry but that I preferred eating my
portion of bread dipped in vinegar and water to this mess,
which even offended the sense of smelling. However, these,
and twenty-two ounces of biscuit, are all the food allowed for
a galley-slave. Each of the crew receives four ounces of this
beverage; that is, provided none of it be secreted before it is
brought upon deck, which is not unfrequently the case.</p>

<p>I once had the curiosity to count the number of beans
which a brother slave had got for all his portion, which
amounted to just thirty; and those of the little black bean,
commonly called horse-beans. We did not even commiserate
one another. To pity, we must be acquainted with the
sufferings of our fellow-creatures, but not feel them. When
we know by experience what pain is, we pity those who suffer;
but when we ourselves are in pain, we then feel only what we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
ourselves undergo. In every station, subject to the calamities of
life, we allow to others that share of our sensibility only which
we have no occasion for ourselves. People in ease, people in
affluence, may think otherwise, but it is not <i>in nature</i>.</p>

<p>Dreadful as this was, I have always thought death a
punishment that was no way adequate to the crimes of some
public <a name="Corr35"></a>villains who have been punished with it; and I am
certain the most cowardly among men, would prefer it to
being a galley-slave. We are condemned to death by nature;
the sentence of the law, and the hand of the hangman, only
anticipate a few months or days; but to be daily wishing for
death, as a friend, to relieve us, and to be debarred of all
means of meeting him, is such a quintessence of wretchedness
as would, I believe, make all mankind keep a strict guard
upon their actions, that they may avoid falling into it.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>From this infernal state of existence I was delivered by Mr
Worthy, who is a slave-merchant&mdash;he saw, and pitied my
distress&mdash;he had accidentally saved the life of one of the
ruffians who had assisted in the attempt to rob my father.
This man afterwards, upon his death-bed, acquainted his
good master of my situation, who promised to release me.
This was effected by his giving a large sum to the captain and
the <i>comite</i>. The secret was told me; it was agreed I should
pretend to faint, and appear insensible; when I should be
thrown into the sea as dead&mdash;This happily succeeded.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more unjust than to confine the instance of
humanity within the narrow circle of a few European nations.
The noble, the generous, the humane dispositions are
diffused throughout all nature, and exert their engaging force
wherever a body of men subsists. Virtue and vice are mingled
in all societies: we have savages in Italy; and there are worthy
men amongst those we call savages. Christians do often those
things which a modest heathen would blush at, and, while
they boast of their religion, are strangers to the common laws
of humanity. It should be the boast of a wise man to despise
nothing that he is not well acquainted with, and to do justice
to all mankind, of whatever country or complexion.&mdash;Virtue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
like the rays of the sun, shines over the whole habitable globe,
enlivens the moral, as that the material world, and exerts its
benign influences from the <i>scorching equinox</i> to the <i>frozen poles</i>.
We feel its force; all communities
are bound together by its magnetic influence; and without it
the nations of Barbary would be covered with devastation,
and no more inhabited than the scorching sands of its
inhospitable deserts.</p>

<p>Mr Worthy no sooner cast his eyes on me, and perceived
my sorrow, than pity, tenderness, and compassion glowed in
his countenance; his eyes moistened with generous sympathy,
and the first word he spoke convinced me that he already felt
<i>all I had suffered</i>. But there is no pleasure so transporting to
him, as to be in any way instrumental in making any of the
human species happy.</p>

<p>I acquiesced in the justice of these sentiments&mdash;and could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
not sufficiently admire the fortitude which had supported the
Marquis under such unheard-of trials! And as our sense of
many high enjoyments, both natural and moral, is exceedingly
heightened by our having observed or experienced many of
the <a name="Corr36"></a>contrary evils; he bids fair at least to be contented, when
he looks back to the horrors he has escaped. The poet says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The heart can ne'er a transport know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That never felt a pain.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It may easily be conceived the Marquis is most anxious to
inquire after his family&mdash;but gratitude to Mr Worthy has
made him accompany him to England.</p>

<p>When I seemed to compassionate his sufferings, his
gratitude assumed a grateful humility; but the moment I
appeared the least inattentive to his misfortunes, his
countenance collected such an air of dignity, as not only
reproached my seeming want of sensibility, but reminded me
also, that his sufferings were not the consequences of guilt,
nor could in the least degree lessen his greatness of mind.</p>

<p>I find Mr Worthy has a law-suit depending; when that is
settled he is to accompany my friend to Italy. He appears to
me a very acute, sensible man;&mdash;we were talking the other
day of the disturbances at Madras, and of the strange conduct
of the people in Leadenhall-Street&mdash;He said it put him in
mind of Anacharsus's observation to Solon, as they were
returning from a public assembly, 'That he could not help
being greatly astonished to find, that, in their deliberations, it
was the <i>wise that spoke</i>, and that <i>fools that decided</i>.' I believe, in
public assemblies, this will be found generally to be the case,
where party governs, and the most powerful cabal is generally
composed of the least rational.</p>

<p>I attend these dear friends everywhere. The Marquis is an
<i>amateur</i>, and his taste will be highly gratified, when at
Munster-house, to view the prodigies of <i>your creation</i>&mdash;he is a
descendant of the Medici family: consequently highly
charmed with the character of the Countess of Darnley. But
this is a subject, I am incapable of entering upon&mdash;to praise
exquisite merit is perhaps the most difficult part of polite
writing, and which I have no talents for; but which if I
possessed, I should tire you with what few other ladies ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
yet was&mdash;<i>their own praises</i>. But I will yield to none in what I
value myself upon, being truly and affectionately.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Villeroy became much enamoured with Lady
Eliza, whose compassion for his misfortunes had so far softened
her heart in his favor, that she listened to him first with
complacency, afterwards with tenderness, and at last with the most
lively interest. Congenial souls soon form an union. She
acknowledged her partiality for him, but that no predilection
whatever could induce her to leave her country and friends. This
opinion was greatly strengthened by the idea she entertained of
the inconstancy of mankind, and the little regard they pay to
women after a few years possession.</p>

<p>The Marquis thought his renouncing his native country would
be too great a sacrifice to be offered at the altar of the Graces. Yet
the idea of parting with Lady Eliza was what he was unable to
support.&mdash;She told him it would be in vain to think of making her
soften the rigour of her decree; for it proceeded from a firmness,
which nothing could conquer! for, from all her observations in life,
no love ever lasted long enough to make it worth while to sacrifice
every thing else to it; the <i>Paradisiac</i> vision of eternal constancy
having long vanished from these sublunary regions:&mdash;and that
unless he would reside in England&mdash;she never would be his!&mdash;A
sigh, which stole from him, conveyed to Lady Eliza the height of
his despair&mdash;his embarrassment and dejection increased her
regard for him, while it awakened a tender commiseration for them,
believing herself entirely the cause of them. She therefore thought it
incumbent on her to endeavour to remove them by every attention in
her power.&mdash;In consequence of this consideration in his favor, she
strove to look cheerful, though she was not a little hurt at finding it
absolutely necessary to reject so amiable and deserving a man.</p>

<p>The Marquis, perceiving that <a name="Corr37"></a>remonstrances would be ineffectual,
took his leave with a heart distracted by grief, perplexity, and
despair! Being naturally of a restless, gloomy disposition, and of
violent passions, in his despair he thought his adventures had been
so extraordinary that he was doomed to be wretched! and formed
a resolution of laying violent hands on himself: and the more he
meditated on his situation, the more strongly was he confirmed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
his precipitate resolution. Yet, as the instinct of self-preservation is
one of the strongest in our frame, it inspired him with a counter-idea,
that of renouncing Italy; this only acquiescence being requisite
to recommend him to Lady Eliza, without whom his life would be
a burthen. He communicated his intentions to Lord Munster, who
apprised his sister of this proof of the Marquis's attachment for
her.</p>

<p>Flattered to the greatest degree at the strength of his affection,
she promised to give him her hand on his return from
Italy&mdash;where he must necessarily go, to prove the identity of his
person, and to take possession of his fortune.</p>

<p>The Marquis made immediate preparations for his journey, and
soon set out, accompanied by his friend Mr Worthy, Mrs Worthy
accompanying Lady Eliza to Munster-house&mdash;Soon after their
arrival Lord and Lady Darnley rejoined them with their little son,
her ladyship being too tender a mother to leave him behind her, or
to commit him to the care of any but herself. The tender brain of
<i>Newton</i>, or <i>Alexander</i>, altered in their infancy by a small
compression, or slight commotion, might have rendered the first
stupid, and the other a wise King&mdash;Yet people in general, though
emulous of obtaining wealth for their heirs, commit them to the
care of uninterested hirelings. Sir Harry Bingley, his aunt and
sister, and most of the parties already introduced to the reader,
assembled at Munster house to spend the summer.</p>

<p>Mrs Lee had rejected every overture from her husband for a
reconciliation, whilst his health and fortune lasted&mdash;but to a
mind like hers, misfortunes cancelled every injury&mdash;His fortune
ruined, his health impaired, he plunged deeper and deeper into
every species of excess. This soon brought him to the greatest
distress, and he was so much reduced as to be in want of the
common necessaries of life. Mrs Lee, upon being informed of his
deplorable situation, immediately converted that villa in Wales, of
which there has been a description given<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>, into money, paid her
husband's debts, and accompanied him at a wretched hovel, to
which his poverty, the consequence of his crimes, and infidelity (<i>to
her</i>) had reduced him.&mdash;There she continued, shewing him every
attention until his decease; when she came with Lady Darnley to
Munster-house.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
<p>Lady Eliza soon received the following Letter from the Marquis
de Villeroy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">Madam,</td><td align="right">Venice.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>On my arrival at this place, I found that, on the report of
my death, my father had consigned over his estate to a near
relation of mine&mdash;who knew me at once, though so
emaciated, and has acted in the most honorable manner to
me. My father has retired to La-Trappe in France: thither
my duty must lead me, previous to the happiness I shall
receive in throwing myself at your feet.</p>

<p>Were I disposed to draw the most engaging <i>portrait</i>
imaginable, I could easily find a subject; but as you may
possibly wish for an intimate acquaintance with the original, I
shall omit the attempt, since it would be difficult for you to
obtain it from that principle in human nature which makes us
strangers <i>to ourselves</i>.</p>

<p>I shall detain your ladyship no longer, than to request you
will inform my friend, your brother, that I am mortified to be
unable to deliver his letter to Mademoiselle de Querci&mdash;no
such person can be found.</p>

<p>Need I paint that passion I have given you such proofs
of?&mdash;No; all descriptions would fall short of my feelings. I
will ever yield to every wish your soul can form; you are
entirely absolute, unless you should attempt impossibilities,
amongst which I reckon this as the greatest&mdash;for me to
breathe a moment without being entirely and inviolably yours.</p>

<p>It may here be, perhaps, proper to inform the reader of what
perhaps his own sagacity may have made him anticipate&mdash;The
Duke de Salis had neither been able, by intreaties or threats, to
compel the Countess de Sons to marry him, though he had given
out that she had; this induced him to keep both her and his
daughter closely confined. It has been already related, how he had
consigned over his son as a house-breaker;&mdash;when he found him
condemned to the gallies&mdash;like the cruel inconsistency of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
<i>Admiral's<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> judges</i>&mdash;he laid himself under the necessity of declaiming
the equity of his own sentence&mdash;and when he found the
decree against his son was inevitable&mdash;unable to bear the
reproaches of his inward monitor, and listening to the whispers of
a gloomy disposition, he became almost frantic&mdash;In this situation
of mind, torn with the agonies of grief, he became more careless
of his ward&mdash;and the Countess and Julia escaped from him&mdash;After
his conduct to his son&mdash;they trembled lest in some act of despair
he should on some future occasion equal the past scene, which
<i>chilled them with horror</i>&mdash;The Countess was seized with the
small-pox, which altered her features considerably, without
impairing her beauty; this circumstance facilitated their eluding all
search after them from the Duke, as Julia wore men's clothes; and
they supported themselves by the sale of jewels.</p>

<p>The intelligent reader now perceives, that Mademoiselle Querci
and her brother, were no other than the Countess de Sons and
Julia, whom Lord Munster had met at Venice.</p>

<p>When the Duke de Salis retired to La-Trappe, the Countess de
Sons appeared, and took possession of her fortune. She had
remained constantly and sincerely attached to Lord Munster was
flattered by his attentions at Venice, and found her esteem
increased by the regard he paid to his pre engagements; but would
not at that time discover herself, fearing that she only flattered
herself that he saw her with the eyes of affection, and lest the
small-pox had made <i>such</i> an alteration, as might change his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
sentiments. Upon the Marquis de Villeroy's arrival in Italy, she
was highly charmed to receive a letter from Lord Munster
addressed to Mademoiselle de Querci, and determined to
accompany him and Julia to England; but this was carefully
concealed, to render the discovery more pleasing.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the family at Munster-house passed their
time most agreeably, though Lord Munster, Sir Harry Bingley,
and Mrs Lee, (who knew nothing of Mr Villars) often were
melancholy and <i>distrait</i>.</p>

<p>Lord Munster made great preparations to celebrate the
anniversary of Lady Darnley's wedding-day: on which occasion a
number of buildings were added to those already mentioned on
the pleasure-grounds&mdash;As all the best artificers were on the spot,
these were executed in the ablest manner. One temple he finished
without the inspection of any one.</p>

<p>On the morning of the masquerade, walking out with Sir Harry
Bingley, he told him he should be glad to have his opinion of it. In
this temple was painted the <i>cataract</i> of the river Dahl, which he
had drawn on the spot<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>&mdash;the cottage where Miss Harris
resided&mdash;and herself at work, in the same way in which he saw
her, with her lovely boy playing beside her (Miss Harris had
permitted Lord Munster to draw her picture, and he had
fortunately taken an exact likeness)&mdash;Sir Harry Bingley started at
beholding it, and exclaimed, 'It is her, it is, by Heaven, it is her!
What artist drew the picture? it is, it is herself!'&mdash;he then sunk
almost motionless in a chair!&mdash;Lord Munster carelessly
answered&mdash;'Bingley, are you mad? That picture <i>cannot</i> concern
you; I painted it from life! Where did you see her? Answer but that
question, and I am gone, gone that instant; the world should not
detain me!' 'It is, it is, my Lord, the lovely woman I told you of.
But her graces were yet more charming still than her beauty! an
external glare of beauty may <i><a name="Corr38"></a>captivate the eye, and ravish the sight</i>; but
it is the graces that win the heart, that powerfully attract every
faculty of a kindred mind!&mdash;I loved her, and was beloved! She
loved my person, not my fortune. Her tenderness, her affection
were my only joy!' 'Why then, replied Lord Munster, did you leave
her? but make yourself easy on her account; she can be nothing to
you; I expect her soon in England.'&mdash;'In England!'&mdash;'Yes, Sir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
in England, I fancy by this time she is married to my friend
Ogilby.' 'Lord Ogilby!' 'Yes; he was passionately in love with her:
she absolutely refused him; but it is not likely, possessing such
beauty, such perfections&mdash;slighted by the author of her exclusion
from every dear and valuable claim in society, relations, friends,
reputation, and protection&mdash;that she should continue deaf to the
earnest solicitations of <i>another</i>, who can restore her to these
advantages&mdash;such a man as Ogilby, a tender lover, who would
sacrifice his time and fortune to her, and who promised he would
be <i>a father to her boy</i>.'</p>

<p>Sir Henry's senses appeared suspended.&mdash;He at last repeated,
'Distraction, madness, fury! But, by the great God of Heaven&mdash;he
shall not be a <i>father to my boy</i>!' The agitation of his spirits rendered
him almost unintelligible: Lord Munster could only understand
that he intended to set out directly&mdash;he therefore dissuaded him
from it&mdash;telling him, that if he refused staying that day (on which
he meant to mark his respect to Lady Darnley) that he must
renounce his friendship for ever! 'My Lord, returned he, I honor,
I love you; your virtues demand the first, your amiable engaging
qualities the last; but were you God instead of man you should not
detain me!&mdash;A few hours may render her the wife of the happy
Ogilby! There is damnation in that thought!'&mdash;As Lord Munster
had contrived an agreeable surprise to Sir Henry&mdash;and Miss
Harris and her child were actually arrived, and concealed at Mr
Burt's, who had taken a separate house, for retirement,&mdash;it was
necessary he should detain him; and as he had forgot to ask where
there scene represented <i>was</i>, he availed himself of that circumstance,
saying, 'Since, Sir, I cannot command your <i>complaisance</i>, I
may at least enforce your <i>obedience</i>, for you know not <i>where</i> to go,
without I tell you&mdash;and my lips shall be sealed up <i>for ever</i>, unless
you pass this night here&mdash;If in the morning you choose to set off, I
will instruct you in every particular.<a name="Corr39"></a>' In the time Lord Munster was
enjoying Sir Harry's happiness&mdash;some of his friends were equally
engaged for him. The Countess de Sons and Julia, the Marquis de
Villeroy, Mr Villars, and Mr Worthy, came to London before the
masquerade&mdash;Mr Villars wrote to Lord Darnley, acquainting him
privately with their arrival, and it was agreed in return they should
all make their appearance on that occasion.</p>

<p>This entertainment was executed equal to the munificence and
taste of Lord Munster&mdash;and as it was given entirely in honor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Lady Darnley, the principal objects in his arrangements had a
reference to her. Never was parental affection more fondly
evinced, never was filial gratitude more entire.&mdash;It has been
already observed, that nothing was ever more elegantly planned
than Munster Village, the farm adjoining, and the pleasure-grounds
which lead to the house: in the farm you wandered from
variety to variety; buildings of great utility and much fancy, groves
inspiring different sensations, from the lucid summits that wake
the mind to gaiety, to the dark brown or <i>clair obscure</i> of trees
crowding their branches together in the vale, which possess the
soul with home-felt contemplation.</p>

<p>Above three hundred of the nobility and people of fashion in the
neighbourhood were invited. Lord and Lady Darnley, Lord
Munster, Lady Eliza, and Mr Worthy, were the only people
unmarked. They received the company in the temple of Minerva,
which faced a fine piece of water, on which there is an island. The
river represented the Styx<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>, the island Elysium, and Charon
ferried over passengers. His boat landing, the names of
Demosthenes, Aristotle, Pindar, Plato, Apelles, Phidias, and
Praxiteles, were announced to Lady Darnley&mdash;They were all
dressed in Grecian habits. Demosthenes, in an elegant harangue,
acquainted her, that the wise Minos had indulged them in their
request, of taking that opportunity of doing homage to her
superlative merit, and to return her thanks for reviving their
memories in the encouragement she gave to the arts and sciences,
as under her patronage the Muses had made Munster Village their
capital seat. He then expatiated on the advantages she had
procured to society&mdash;the influence of the philosophic spirit in
humanizing the mind, and preparing it for intellectual exertion and
delicate pleasures&mdash;in exploring, by the help of geometry, the
system of the universe&mdash;in promoting navigation, agriculture,
medicine, and moral and political science. Lady Darnley (though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
totally unprepared, being ignorant of her nephew's plans) made a
very ready and polite answer, returning them thanks for the honor
they did her, which (she said) as it could afford them no other
<i>pleasure</i>, than that of <i>obliging</i>, rendered the obligation greater.
Demosthenes replied, that great geniuses are always superior to
their own abilities.</p>

<p>Some time after Charon was observed to land some passengers
in Roman habits; they proved to be Cicero, Lucretius, Livy, Virgil,
Horace, Ovid, Varro, Tibullus, and Vitruvius. Cicero advancing,
made Lady Darnley a speech similar to that of Demosthenes&mdash;as
like thoughts will be ever born of the like subjects, by people who
live in corresponding periods of the <i>progression of manners</i>. In such
cases some considerable <i>similarity</i> of expression may be
occasioned by the agency of <i>general principles</i>. Lady Darnley made
a gracious reply, intimating her small merit, and the apprehensions
she felt that physical causes might impede her good intentions;
that her powers had been limited; but that she was far from
thinking with Boileau, that wherever there is a Mæccenas, a Virgil
or an Horace will arise, (curtsying to these gentlemen.) Cicero
observed to her the happiness she enjoyed in living at a <i>period</i>
distinguished by men of such shining abilities in every department!</p>

<p>Lady Darnley answered, that he honored her countrymen very
much: that she acknowledged we have at present very able men in
every department; but that in morality she was afraid we have
refined more upon the <i>vices</i> of the ancients than <i>their virtues</i>, and
she could not help questioning whether there was any minister,
magistrate, or lawyer, now in Europe, who could explain the
discoveries of Newton, or the ideas of Leibnitz, in the same
manner as the principles of Zeno, Plato, and Epicurus, had been
illustrated at Rome<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.</p>

<p>He thanked her for her polite compliment, and retired with his
companions.</p>

<p>They were succeeded by Italians, who were announced
Lawrence de Medicis, Michael Angelo, Raphael, Titian, Ariosto,
and Tasso. Lawrence de Medicis expressed his happiness from
having been permitted the honor of paying his respects to her, and
admiring the works of her creation, and complimented her in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
name of his friends for the encouragement she had afforded the
arts.&mdash;She said, the applause of the worthy is too valuable to be
received with indifference; but still modestly declined the praises
bestowed on her, saying, she had endeavoured to follow <i>his</i>
example, although the imitation was <i>a faint one</i>; and that the only
commendation she aspired to was from <i>the attempt</i>. That without
her assistance, she made no doubt, if physical causes did not
prevent it<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>, that the society for the encouragement of arts,
manufactures, and commerce in London, is well calculated to
diffuse a spirit of taste in this nation&mdash;a society, which, without
neglecting what tends more immediately to the improvement of
agriculture, and the necessary arts of life, gives the most honorable
encouragement to those which are elegant and ornamental. Had
such a society been instituted fifty years ago, London, perhaps by
this time, would have been the grand seat of the arts, as it is the
envied seat of freedom.</p>

<p>Michael Angelo, that celebrated restorer of the arts of painting,
sculpture, and architecture, expressed how infinitely he was
charmed with Munster Village<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.&mdash;'What is really beautiful, said
he, does not depend either upon fashion, or times; there may be
<i>different ways</i> of expressing things in different ages; but there can
only <i>be one</i> of conceiving them properly.' The temple, in which
they were, was adorned with the paintings of Raphael<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>, copied by
an able artist. Lady Darnley, pointing to these, (and addressing
him) said 'There is proof how much we fall short, how faintly we
copy originals!'&mdash;Raphael replied, that her ladyship did him much
honor; the pieces she had selected, had met with the suffrage of
the public; but that, in his own acceptation, <i>the cartoons</i> were the
best of his performances&mdash;which he apprehended a juster
prevailing taste at present condemned: Otherwise the father of his
people, approved of by Minos&mdash;so good so indulgent a prince to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
his subjects&mdash;would not lock them up from public observations.&mdash;Lady
Darnley was here quite at a loss; she blushed, hesitated,
unwilling either to refuse her sovereign <i>taste</i> or <i>philanthropy</i>!</p>

<p>Lawrence de Medicis perceiving her situation, in pity of her
confusion, retired with his company.</p>

<p>Charon again landed a groupe of figures; their dress declared
them English, of the reign of King Charles II&mdash;They proved to be
the Duke of Buckingham<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>, Sir William Petty, Mr Dryden, Mr
Locke, Mr Waller<a name="Corr40"></a>, etc. The Duke addressed Lady Darnley with
that polite address peculiar to himself in his age, and which has
since been sedulously studied, to the prevention of qualities which
it should only be the harbinger of&mdash;he expatiated on her merit;
that she had obliged the whole nation, as every one individual
might receive improvement or pleasure by her means.&mdash;Lady
Darnley returned him a most gracious answer, still intimating her
apprehensions, that the arts perhaps were not likely to thrive in this
soil, where our pursuits, opinions, and inclinations, vary with the
weather&mdash;that the declension of letters after the reign of Charles
II. but too fully justified her opinion.&mdash;The Duke answered her,
that indeed that was the common and received opinion, and that
the reign she mentioned was the Augustan age in England; but
that he had the honor to assure her, that a just taste was by no
means then formed.&mdash;The progress of philological learning, and
the <i>Belles Lettres</i> was obstructed by the institution of the Royal
Society, which turned the thoughts of men of genius to physical
inquiries.&mdash;To that body we were indebted for the discoveries
relating to light, the principle of gravitation, the motion of the
fixed stars, the geometry of transcidental qualities; but that it was
left to her ladyship to revive the agreeable arts, for which her
name must be handed down to posterity with honor.</p>

<p>The following dialogue ensued between Charon and a Beau.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beau.&mdash;I have seen all parts of the world, and should like to
take a view of Elysium, being rather tired of this side of the

Mercury to Charon.&mdash;He is too frivolous an animal to
present to the wife Minos!</p>

<p>Charon.&mdash;Minos, Sir, knows nothing of <i>the graces</i>&mdash;but if
you please I will row you to the infernal regions.</p>

<p>Beau.&mdash;With all my heart, I believe I shall meet more people
of fashion there<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>; but, good master Charon, in what way shall I
pass my time?</p>

<p>Charon.&mdash;If you are fond of doing nothing (a favourite
passion with many fine gentlemen) Theseus will readily resign
his seat to you: or if it is your genius, like many others, to
choose to be,</p>

<p class="center-block">
'<i>Though without business, yet in full employ,</i>'<br />
</p>

<p>you may join Sisyphus, or accompany the Danaides.</p>

<p>Beau.&mdash;Neither of these will suit me; <i>idleness</i> is <i>insipid</i>, and I
<i>detest business</i>! But are there no public places?</p>

<p>Charon.&mdash;O! yes; great variety: each person in that place
pursues those inclinations, whereby he had been swayed, or had
rendered himself remarkable here on earth.</p>

<p>Beau.&mdash;There are fine women then, of course?</p>

<p>Charon.&mdash;As to women, no seraglio in the world comes up
to it; as a part of whatever the world, since its creation, has ever
yet produced, of lovely and enchanting amongst women are
there assembled.&mdash;There you may view and gaze, with
admiration, upon Helen, whose bewitching charms were so
destructive to the family, the city, and the empire of King
Priam.&mdash;On each side of her are Galatea, and Bressis, Lais,
Phryne, and thousands more&mdash;There also you may behold in all
their charms, in the full lustre of attraction, and decked in every
grace, some of those happy fair-ones, whom the greatest poets,
so lavish in their praise, have in their lays immortalised; such,
amongst many others, are the Corinna of Ovid, the Lydia of
Horace, the Lesbia of Catullus, the Delia of Tibullus, the
Licoris of Gallus, and the Cynthia of Propertius.</p>

<p>Beau.&mdash;I will go; I am enchanted with the idea of seeing
these <i>dear creatures</i>.&mdash;But I will shiver the wheel and distaff of
the Destinies against the wall, and spoil their housewifery&mdash;I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
take their spindle, where hang the threads of human life like
beams driven from the sun, and mix them all together, kings
and beggars! But hark'ee, master Charon, is there good music? I
cannot do well without music!</p>

<p>Charon.&mdash;There are all kinds of concerto's and opera's,
both vocal and instrumental, executed by the very <i>best</i> of the
Italians, and the most celebrated voices from every part of the
world. There are various pieces performed in all languages, and
in all kinds of taste, for the universal satisfaction of the
audience. Those who have a taste for ancient music, will be
more gratified than they can be in Tottenham-street<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>. They will
hear with admiration the gentle flute of Marsius, be ravished
with the thorough-bass of Stentor, and expire with delight at the
thrilling note of Misurus's trumpet.</p>

<p>Beau.&mdash;All this is charming; but what sort of a table is kept?
One cannot altogether live on <i>love</i> and <i>music</i>, though one must
<i>languish</i> and <i>expire</i> without them, as well <i>as with them</i>!</p>

<p>Charon.&mdash;If you are fond of good cheer, you have nothing
to do but to pay a visit to Tantalus. Are you thirsty? The Styx,
the Cocytus, and the Phlegethon present their waves to your
acceptance.</p>

<p>Beau.&mdash;I should indeed rather prefer the nectar of the
Gods&mdash;but as I shall not stay long (for I make it a rule never to
stay long in a place) water may suffice!</p>

<p>Charon.&mdash;It would have been as easy to have escaped from
the Labyrinth of Dædalus, as the infernal regions!</p>

<p>Beau.&mdash;I have always (though as wild as March, and
inconstant as April) been a favourite with the fair! Ariadne
procured for her Theseus a means of escape.</p>

<p>Charon.&mdash;I make no doubt, from your conversation, that
you are not only the favourite, but the blessed Adonis of all the
women: but <i>that</i> will avail you nothing. Lucifer, the unpitying
Lucifer, though you should promise to offer him every day three
hundred bulls in sacrifice<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, would not lend you even one of the
smallest of his imps to help you to get out.</p>

<p>Beau.&mdash;Did not Hercules escape from it, and carry
Cerberus along with him? Did not Æneas (with the assistance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the golden bough, and led by the Cumæan Sybil) take the same
journey to pay a visit to his father? Why may not I, like Orpheus,
go to visit it while living?</p>

<p>Charon.&mdash;Orpheus was particularly indulged, and Eurydice
restored to him on account of his charming voice, and the
delightful music of his lyre! You have no such pretensions. But
Alecto, Megara, and Tysiphone, will receive you graciously and
open the gates of <i>Tartarus</i> to you. The least of your exploits will
entitle you to their attentions:&mdash;they are too good, too
reasonable, too indulgent to require from you the very great
pains you have taken, through the whole course of your life, to
recommend yourself to them.</p>

<p>Beau.&mdash;Let us go then, old boy! I will try what a little
flattery <a name="Corr41"></a>will do with them! I can <i>say with Cæsar</i>, I wonder what
fear is!&mdash;(Aside) But my heart plaguily misgives me for <i>all that</i>!
but in my circumstances I must change for the better; my
money is gone; and as I never gamed, I cannot expect the <i>club</i>,
<i>or the waiters at the club</i>, to make <i>a subscription for me</i>!</p></div>

<p>Two peers and a baronet applied to Charon, to ferry them over
to Munster-house: but Mercury again interfered, telling Lord
C&mdash;&mdash;d that although he had been thought in the world not to
have been <i>sans quelque goût</i> in the <i>belle maniere</i>, and had been an
encourager of the <i>Belles Lettres</i>, yet as Minos only permitted them
to come back to the world (in the present case) to do honor to
superlative feminine merit, none but such who had paid a proper
respect to the sex in their life-time could be indulged in that
pleasure. But if he would burn his book (wherein he depreciates
women, and considers them only as the toys of dalliance) in <i>the
fiery billows of Phlegethon</i>, he would intercede for him with Minos.
This the peer rejecting, his brother the baronet intreated to be
permitted to go in his stead; but Mercury reminded him, he had
pulled down a house built by Inigo Jones, and therefore could
have no pretensions to taste!</p>

<p>Lord L&mdash;&mdash;n was ferried over by himself; and after paying
his compliments to Lady Darnley, returned; when the following
dialogue took place in Elysium between his lordship, and the other
peer above mentioned.</p>

<p>Lord C&mdash;&mdash;d.&mdash;&mdash; Your lordship may believe that I could
have no great pleasure in seeing a woman's follies: I was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
desirous of inquiring what they are doing at home, or in America?
Did I desire to punish an enemy in the severest manner, I would
inflict nothing worse upon him than to oblige him to listen to all
the follies in which he has no share, and to be witness to gaieties
in which he cannot partake. My heart was never dilated by the
amplitude of generous principles; nothing was ever interesting to
me, but in proportion as it contributed to my <i>own</i> particular
<i>gratifications</i>. Curiosity now however prevailed with me to attempt
going to discover in what way they are going on, being
apprehensive of the consequences of the measures formerly
adopted. Whoever would deprive men of their natural rights, is an
enemy to the race of men; and he that thinks it can be effectuated
without universal mischief, is a stranger to the ways of Providence;
the most invariable rule of which is, That nothing contradictory to
its original laws shall ever be accomplished, either of a physical or
moral nature, without bringing ruin on that people which has
instituted it. How few are capable of distinguishing the good and
pernicious effects which will follow the instituting a new law,
before it is enacted! To remedy present evils, they make a law
which brings greater mischiefs along with it, though imperceptible
to their shallow capacities. No two understandings on earth are
more different than a judicial and legislative; many men enjoy the
first, who have not the least emanation of the second. When a law
is to be founded, which depends on the first principles in human
nature, there genius only can effectuate any discovery of truth; the
mind must dart forward into futurity, from the principles which it
knows in human nature: a genius of quite a different kind from
that of distinguishing between right and wrong in any particular
case. The first only can form the legislator, and plan laws of utility
and public good, the latter decide of the consequences of them
when they are made. The one capacity is the most rare, most
excellent and beneficial blessing bestowed on man; the other to be
found in almost all mankind, or attainable by habit, yet useful
when confined to its proper sphere of action, and not permitted to
rove, with the imagination of the superior <i>few</i>, amongst the regions
of exalted genius.</p>

<p>Lord L&mdash;&mdash;n.&mdash;&mdash; It is not enough, my Lord, that the
English are a <i>miserable</i>, they render themselves a <i>ridiculous</i> people:
And, after all the noise the brawlers make in the lower house, they
only fight the battles, aid the wishes of the Americans, and exalt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the triumph of the French! In private life it is reckoned a good
expedient, for the sake of an easy, quiet life, to be patient and
submissive under what are supposed <i>necessary evils</i>: but I differ so
much from this maxim, that I am convinced those will ever be <i>trod
upon</i> who <i>creep</i>; and that certain submissions derogatory to a sense
of honor in an individual or the nation, never <i>prevent the blow</i>,
though it may be <i>protracted</i> for a reason, in order to lay it on with a
redoubled force at a time our strength is weakened, and that we
are debilitated by our mortifications and a sense of the
submissions we have made injurious to the honor of an individual
or the pride of the nation. It is a mortifying area, but must have its
place in the annals of this disgraced kingdom, whilst extravagance
and every species of gaieties daily increase.</p>

<p>I am sorry to acquaint your Lordship, that the publication of
your book has given in England the same wound to morality and
business as the publication of <i>the spirit of laws</i> has given in France
to the monarchical constitution. The English study nothing now
but the <i>Graces</i>. Procrastination is the <i>ton</i>, because any thing <i>abrupt
is ungraceful</i>. The increase of manners has always been thought as
imperceptible as the hand of a clock, which though in constant
motion cannot be distinguished in <i>that motion</i>. But your book has
occasioned a more rapid change: your countrymen having
exchanged the <i>armour of Mars</i> for the <i>amours of Venus</i>, their
<i>greatness of mind</i> and <i>magnanimity</i> for <i>trifling pursuits</i>; and, instead
of speaking forcibly in the senate, they whine a tale of love in the
ear of their mistresses: having descended suddenly, like skilful
musicians, from the <i>forte</i> and the <i>pomposo</i> to the <i>pia</i> and the
<i>pianissimo</i>. Refinement will bring us back to barbarity&mdash;far be it
from me to suppose such an event can happen suddenly; but in
the course of a few years, I make no doubt, as a man in days of
yore that could read <i>had the benefit of clergy</i>, so will a man be
esteemed an able minister, or an expert negotiator of business, if
he can write a pretty sonnet&mdash;or dance a good minuet.</p>

<p>Lord C&mdash;&mdash;d.&mdash;&mdash; The graces, my lord, I still say, the
graces for ever&mdash;and as to dancing, can there be any science more
useful for a minister to learn&mdash;to figure <i>out</i> with a good grace,
never to <i>lose time</i>, and not even to nod, instead of <i>sleeping a
century</i>?<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>
<p>Two other passengers applied to Charon to ferry them over the
Styx, Homer and Ossian.</p>

<p>Mercury told Charon that he might carry Homer to Olympus,
and place him with the Demigods; but he could not be permitted
to go to Munster-house, for the same reason Lord C&mdash;&mdash;d had
been rejected: But Ossian had a just claim to that indulgence.</p>

<p>The Chief of other years being landed, addressed Lady Darnley
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ossian.&mdash;&mdash;I have escaped from <i>the narrow-house</i><a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>! I have
crossed <i>Col-amon</i><a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>, O daughter of Munster, to behold thy glory.
My joy returns as when I first beheld the maid, the white-bosomed
daughter of strangers, <i>Moina</i><a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> with the dark blue eyes:
But <i>Crimiona</i><a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> should be thy name, for thou art the guiding star
of the women of Albion, who mark no years with their deeds!
Time rolls on, seasons return, but they are still unknown. Vanity
is their recompence; and when their years shall have an end, no
grey stone shall rise to their renown! But the departure of thy
soul shall be a stream of light! A thousand bards shall sing of
thy praise; and the maids of harmony, with their trembling
harps, shall relate thy mighty deeds!</p>

<p>Thy son, when the years of his youth shall arise, will raise the
mould about thy stone, and bid it speak to other years! The joy
of his grief will be great! Like the memory of joys that are past,
pleasant and mournful to the soul. He will say, 'she will not
come forth in her beauty, will move no more in the steps of her
loveliness: but she will be like the rainbow on streams, or the
gilding of sun-beams on the hills! She has not fallen unknown!
Her fame surrounded her like light; her rays, like those of the
sun, cherished all on whom they fell. Her wealth was the
support of the needy; the weak rested secure in her halls! She
softened at the sight of the sad; her blue eyes rolled in tears for
the afflicted; her breast of snow heaved for the oppressed; and
the moving of her lips assuaged their grief!&mdash;O sons of Albion,
may you behold her son, like the <i>halo</i> of the <i>rainbow</i>, exhibit <i>the
same</i> though <i>fainter colours</i>!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Darnley.&mdash;Father of heroes, dweller of eddying
winds, thy praise gladdens my heart! My soul is exalted, my
fame secured, by the voice of Conna<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>! Thou hast been a beam
of light to latter times, as <a name="Corr42"></a>thy mighty deeds have been
remembered, though <a name="Corr43"></a>thou hast long been a blast!</p>

<p>Thy renown grew only on the fall of the haughty; thy foes
were the sons of the guilty; but thine arms rescued the feeble!</p>

<p>Thou wentest forth in echoing steel, and conquered the king
of many isles: He brought thee his daughter Oina-moral, as an
offering of peace. She was gentle as the evening breeze; her hair
was of a raven black, and her bosom vied in whiteness with the
<i>Canna</i><a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> on the Fuar-Bhean<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.&mdash;And though thy locks were
young, yielded her to the hero she loved<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>! But like unto
Cathmor<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> of old, I perceive the sound of thy praises is
displeasing to thine ear!</p>

<p>Ossian.&mdash;Just praise, like the water of a <i>clear fountain</i>, was
ever pleasant to my taste; but I never rejoiced in unmerited
applause, resigning that <i>muddy joy</i> to the sons of later days!</p>

<p>It is true, O daughter of Albion, that, surrounded by the
valiant in arms, I conquered the king of many isles&mdash;that he
presented the maid to me in her loveliness as an offering of
peace! She purpled the morn with blushes as she approached,
and scattered such bright rays, as the sun might have dressed
his beams with for that day's glory! But she had given her heart
to another, and met my eyes of love with sorrow! In thrilling
notes vibrating from her inmost soul, she conveyed to me the
pangs of her heart! 'Breaker of the shield (said she) give ear
unto the voice of mourning, attend to my tale, of woe&mdash;a tale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
which though thy eyes of steel are used more to strike fire than
shed a tear, must have that power to move thee.'</p>

<p>My parents had seen many returning seasons with their
springs, but no offspring of theirs arose. My mother lamented a
disgrace, scarce known amongst the daughters of Caledonia.
She consulted the cunning-man of the rock: He said,
'Daughter, be of good cheer; take the son of thine adversary
that is low, rear him; thy piety will be rewarded; thou shalt have
a daughter whom thou <i>must give him to wife</i>!' When she declared
this unto my father (as she was stricken in years) there
immediately ran a smile over his face, like the little ruffling of
water when a gentle breeze breathes upon the surface of a lake;
but he adopted Tonthormid, and some moons after I came forth
as a flower; but as the bud, hit with an envious worm ere he can
spread his sweet leaves to the air, or dedicate his beauty to the
sun, dies, so shall I soon fly away as a shadow. Not the white
down that decks the silver swan is more unlike the sooty raven's
back, than my lover from the rest of his sex. Bred up with him,
my first accents were attuned to love; he took delight in my
infantine caresses. Time ran on with its years&mdash;My father
corrected my tenderness; and I became sensible of my error as
soon as I was conscious of my feelings. Tonthormid also, from
our inequality of fortune, tried to suppress his passion, judging
what was then a lambent fire, would soon blaze into a flame!
True love, like the lily of the vale, is fond of concealment; but,
as the fragrancy of the one occasions its discovery, so does the
concealment of the other prove its reality! I loved and was
beloved; my father saw, and approved our passion. A succession
of moons had not frozen the genial current of his soul, nor
repeated shocks blunted all its tenderest sensations&mdash;But we
were ignorant of his intentions. When he appointed us to meet
him at his cave of contemplation, the heart of Tonthormid
palpitated with fear, mine with hope&mdash;we had a considerable
way to go, but <i>remained silent</i>!&mdash;we walked through a pleasant
grassy walk, shaded with rows of lime-trees, at the side of which
ran along, in plaintive murmurs, a crystal brook, on the side of
whose mazy and translucent stream were planted bushes of
various kinds, with birds in high harmony on the sprays.</p>

<p>Arrived at the cave, my father announced to my lover that he
must prepare to accompany him to battle! Aghast he stood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
silent as the midnight hour, unmoved as the statue of despair!
The venerable Chief reproached him for his coldness.</p>

<p>'Alas! said he, the din of arms is no more offensive to my ear
than the murmuring of falling waters, the vernal breeze sighing
through the leaves, or the melodious song of the evening
nightingale; but if we should fall in battle, what will become of
this lovely maid?'</p>

<p>My father, swearing by the great Loda, promised I should be
his&mdash;if we conquered&mdash;but reminded him, that</p>

<p>
'Love should be the zephyr, not the whirlwind of the soul!'<br />
</p>

<p>Tonthormid was all rapture, while every line in my
countenance, witnessed my satisfaction. We were restored to
that unexpected tranquility of spirits, which naturally follows a
great dejection in most minds, when the first pangs are
somewhat abated&mdash;not unlike that stillness in the sky which is
sometimes observed when two opposite and gentle winds have
just overcome one another's motion&mdash;or like the tide at the
moment of high water, before it has received the contrary
direction.</p>

<p>They set out, receiving my caresses, intermixed with smiles
and tears, like an April sun shining through transient showers.
They met the foe, <i>conquered</i>, and <i>returned</i>.</p>

<p>The feast of shells was prepared, the maids of mirth attended
with their harps, and the rising sun would have beheld me
Tonthormid's! The virgins envied me in the hall, my steps were
strewed with flowers, and I was happiest, where a thousand are
happy. The subtile air was calm from mists, and water with her
curled waves swept the bounded channels of the deep; the
nightingales were heard in the grove, and soothed my soul with
tender tales of love; not a breeze breathed through the trees; all
nature was still, as if it paid homage to our passion. But oh! my
summer's day was soon turned into winter's night! Ah, soul
ambition! which like water-floods, not channel bound, dost
neighbours overrun!&mdash;fell violence leaped forth like thunder
wrapped in a ball of fire! Thou camest with thy men of steel; I
beheld thee from the clefts of the rock; terrors turned upon me,
like an earthquake they shook my trembling heart! they still
pursue my soul as the wind. My joy is withered; my welfare has
passed away like a cloud; my comforts have been like winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
suns, that rise late and set betimes, set with thick clouds, that
hide their light at noon!'</p>

<p>Thus sang the maid in her grief, like the <i>Lus-cromicina</i>,
bending in pensive silence, a beautiful flower drooping in the
shade, wanting the beams of the sun to revive it. She soon
perceived my heart was not made of brass, or carved from the
stony rock. Hope animated her weakened spirits, whilst the
dignity of her soul irradiated every feature; the blush of modesty
stole over the cheek, and the graces dwelt on her coral lips.
Sweet as the dew from heaven her lovely accents fell, and
moved me. She proceeded, 'I see my tears have mollified thy
heart! If fame tells true, never over the fallen did thine eyes
rejoice, and thou knowest the herbs on the hill!<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Restore me
then to the hero that is low; my tears will refresh him, as the
dew of the morning doth the green herbage!&mdash;He mocked at
fear; never retired from the foe, or was ever vanquished, but by
the son of Fingal! Glorious is it to thee, O hero! great will be
thy renown; thou hast subdued the first of men!</p>

<p>Were the earth his bed, a rock his pillow, his curtain heaven,
with him alone could I be blessed! From a rock that weeps a
running crystal, I will fill his shell cup. I'll gently raise his
weakened body<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>, and the murmur of this water, instead of
music, shall charm him into sleep; and whilst he sleeps my cares
shall watch to preserve him from the beast of prey! The fern on
the heath, if cut a thousand times, represents the same
figure&mdash;so is the image of my love engraved on the inmost core
of my heart! I hold the <i>thread</i> of his peace: can I forget its
delicate texture, or that it is warped with <i>those</i> of his heart? I
could grow to my hero like ivy; but like the aspenleaf I tremble,
like the sensitive plant I shrink back at thy approach! Thou
mayest swim against the stream with a crab, feed against the
wind with the deer, but thou canst never possess my heart! Love
for him, or grief, are the only passions that can fill the heart of
Oinamoral! But thou mayest go forth in echoing steel and
increase thy glory&mdash;or the hearts of a thousand other virgins,
will beat an unison to thy sighs, and return thy passion!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus sung the daughter of many isles; her trembling harp
was turned to mourning, and her lute into the voice of them that
weep. My heart was never wrought of steel, nor hewn out of the
rugged pebble; but she would have extracted honey out of the
rock, and oil out of the flinty rock! My heart was <i>tender</i>, though
my <i>arm was strong</i>! I resigned her to the man of her soul! But I
had the supreme delight of exhaling the falling tear from the
cheek of beauty, as when the pearly dew on the surface of the
narcissus, and the snow-drop evaporates at the kindly instance
of the solar ray. Had I been deaf to her tale of woe, I should
have merited a cold chill to extinguish my flame, as if a <i>thousand
winters</i> contracted <i>into one</i>, scattered their snow and froze the
very centre! No praises can be due for refraining from barbarity,
unknown till the sons of refinement came into the world!</p>

<p>Lady Darnley.&mdash;A great mind is ever tenacious of even the
shadow of a favor received, but loses the idea of a benefit
conferred&mdash;In what way, O first of men! shall I welcome thy
approach? Wilt thou partake of the feast of shells, or be honored
with the dangers of the chase?</p>

<p>Ossian.&mdash;Chase was never to me such sport as the battle of
the shields! But this is a tale of the times of old, the deeds of
the days of other years; manners alter with times, as the earth by
the seasons. Let the sons of Albion listen to the voice of Conna,
'Never search for battle, nor fear it when it comes.'</p>

<p>Ossian retired, and a hangman from the assizes told Lady
Darnley, that she had ruined his trade; for, all the poor of the
country-side being employed in manufactures, etc. they had no
inducement to steal, theft being the necessary consequence of
idleness<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p>

<p>The hangman retired; and Lady Darnley was addressed by a
few women in tattered robes. Making an apology for their dress,
they said, it was her ladyship who had condemned them to those
unseemly garbs. She inquired, In what way she was culpable to
them? They answered, By not only promoting industry, which
was highly detrimental to their interests, but also procuring by
her munificence theatrical and other entertainments for man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>kind,
which completed their misfortunes, as it rendered
ineffectual their allurements:&mdash;that they might formerly (out of
the profits of their industry) have purchased annuities, like other
eminent personages in the age, and <i>lived comfortably</i> on the
<i>distresses of others</i>; but that they had always too much conscience,
and too great and generous souls for that:&mdash;that they were now
reduced to the alternative of removing from that part of the
country, or starving where they were; and, preferring the first to
the last, they had determined to go to Birmingham, where,
under the auspices of the magistrates<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> of that place, they would
have a good chance of succeeding in their profession; as it had
always been found that recreations of some kind are necessary,
and that if innocent amusements were denied, mankind would
have recourse to the other.</p></div>

<p>The Goddess of Folly, with her cap and bells, approached Lady
Darnley; who, smiling, asked her what had procured her the honor
of her company? She answered, That being excluded at all other
times from these regions, it induced her to come then, where she
flattered herself, for one night in her life, not to be ridiculed; as it
is only Absurdity that laughs at Folly. Her ladyship replied, That
none indeed were entitled to smile at another's weakness, who are
conscious of their own.</p>

<p>Miss Bingley, by her aunt's request, was in the character of a
pastoral shepherdess, and affected to by vastly coy, and a great
huntress. She said she wielded the crook and the javelin with
equal dexterity; and that though she was terrified at the voice or
appearance of a lover, yet she made nothing of lopping off the
head of a wild boar, or of thrusting a spear into the jaws of a lion.
She was pursued by (James Mordaunt as) a pastoral lover. Lady
Darnley told her that such swains are mighty good-natured, and
never do any mischief to any <i>but themselves</i>; a leap from a rock, or a
plunge into a river, being their usual catastrophe.</p>

<p>Lord Munster walked away with Sir Harry Bingley, and shewed
him, on one of the back grounds a cottage similar to that
represented in the temple above-mentioned. They advanced, and
saw Miss Harris, and her lovely boy playing at her feet. Sir Harry
fixed his eyes, and with a peculiar wildness exclaimed, Sport not,
my friend, with my sorrows!&mdash;Lord Munster assured him of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
reality; but he almost swooned away at the discovery, and was
perfectly enchanted with his lovely boy. Every explanation taking
place to their mutual satisfaction, Mr Burt being in the secret,
and some more friends, the ceremony was immediately performed,
and Miss Harris was introduced that very evening, as Lady
Bingley, to the family at Munster-house.</p>

<p>Lord Munster, leaving this happy pair, joined Lord Sombre;
two ladies <a name="Corr45" ></a>passed by them, one in a habit <a name="Corr44" ></a>similar to that
Mademoiselle de Querci had wore at the masquerade at Venice:
the other had assumed the figure of Diana. Struck with their
majestic appearance, they followed them. The mask of the latter
dropped, as if ashamed to conceal so much beauty. Lord Sombre
stooping, instantly restored to her the <i>unfaithful</i> guardian of her
charms. The lady, covered with that agreeable confusion inherent
to the sex, apologized for the trouble she had given him! He
replied, he could not but acknowledge that it was a trouble to him
to be the instrument of depriving the company of the sight of so
much beauty. That, Sir, replied she, may be your opinion; but my
intention is to see, and <i>not be seen</i>. But a lady, replied his lordship,
who represents Diana, would appear more in character if she
could consent not <i>to be concealed</i>, nor to hide those beams of
brightness which were designed to be the light of the world. Sir,
said she, if I must support my character, it is not at all the less in
my power because my mask is on, being still the moon though in
eclipse&mdash;but my intention of appearing in the character of Diana,
was to keep Actæon at a distance.</p>

<p>In the mean time Lord Munster had neither seen or heard the
above conversation, the whole powers of his soul being absorbed
in attention to the lady first mentioned. But what were his
emotions, when he knew the well known voice of Mademoiselle de
Querci! She told him, that she believed he was the gentleman who
was still denominated at Venice <i>Il Febo del Inghilterra</i>! He told her,
it was impossible he could have any pretensions to so flattering a
distinction; but intreated to know whether he could believe that he
had the happiness of addressing the woman he adored, whom
from motives of honor he had been induced to suppress his
passion for, but which scruples on his part he had been relieved
from since that period? Mademoiselle de Querci (for it was she
herself) answered, that every apology he could make for his
infidelity to the Countess de Sons, would only lessen him in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
esteem, as, to her certain knowledge, she was still single, and
fondly attached to him. Had it been otherwise (said she) my Lord,
I should have cheerfully <i>consented</i> to what I must now refuse, as I
never will act in opposition to the interest of the Countess. Lord
Munster, flattered at her coming to Munster-house, asked if she
was perfectly sincere in the favourable hint she had given
him&mdash;that nothing but his pre-engagement would have prevented
her from according herself to his wishes? She answered, I desire,
my Lord, you'll not judge me by your country-women; for, from
what I have heard of their characters, there is no well-bred woman
who ever makes any pretensions to <i>sincerity</i>. Does not every body
say what they do not mean, and promise what they never intend to
perform? and yet all of them, to a single woman, will compliment
the justness of your remarks.&mdash;In Italy we are more sincere; and I
now have the honor to assure you, that nothing at present occupies
my thoughts, or interests me equal to your fulfilling of your
engagements with the Countess de Sons, whose constancy for you
demands on your part every return. In saying this, a sigh escaped
Mademoiselle de Querci, which took refuge in Lord Munster's
bosom&mdash;while her blushes raised hopes which her tongue denied
confirming! Her lover felt a severe struggle between love and
honor.&mdash;The most severe misfortune to a virtuous man is to be
in such a state that he can hardly so act as to approve his own
conduct. But his distraction was increased, in finding
Mademoiselle de Querci had taken advantage of his <i>reverie</i> to
retire, with a composure that <a name="Corr46" ></a>deceived his vigilance, and an
address which prevented his distrust.&mdash;He went every where in
pursuit of her, but she eluded his search.</p>

<p>A magician with two enchanted knights addressed Lady Eliza,
who (I have already observed) was dressed as a slave attending
Mrs Worthy. He told her he would unfold her future fate, and, if
she would retire to a place of privacy, he would convince her, and
the queen she attended, that he was very well skilled in the science
of astrology. Lord and Lady Darnley; Lord Sombre, Lord
Munster, and Mrs Lee begged leave to accompany them. The two
knights accompanied the magician, who he said must remain
enchanted until they were released by the hands of their fair
mistresses. After several magical incantations, he told Lady Eliza
many things concerning the Marquis de Villeroi, and Mrs Lee of
Mr Villars. But he astonished Lord Munster more particularly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
telling him he was a <i>perplexed lover</i>&mdash;but assured him that he would
be soon relieved from his anxiety; and that perhaps that very
evening would terminate his adventures, and render all the present
company joyful! Could you do this, replied Lord Munster, I would
swear you had more wit than Mercury, or his son Autolycus, who
was able to change black into white!</p>

<p>In the mean time two ladies appeared: They were majestic in
their persons, and very magnificent in their apparel. The magician,
addressing himself to the company, said, if it was agreeable, he
would give them ocular proofs of his art. They answered, By all
means! He then presented one of the enchanted knights to Lady
Eliza, the other to Mrs Lee, and Lord Munster to one of the
ladies who had just appeared (in the mean time Lord Darnley had
prevented the admission of other company.)&mdash;He then desired
them all to unmask. The agreeable discovery this produced is not
easy to give an adequate idea of; as the magician was no other than
Mr Worthy; the enchanted knights, the Marquis de Villeroi, and
Mr Villars; and the Lady Mademoiselle de Querci.&mdash;Mr Worthy
then, addressing Lord Munster, said, Your perplexity, my Lord,
now ceases:&mdash;This Lady is the Countess de Sons (whose smiles
confirmed her previous conversation with him that evening<a name="Corr46a"></a>.) He
made his suitable acknowledgments: whilst Lord Sombre was
enchanted to discover, in the Countess's companion, his lovely
Diana, who had changed her dress, and proved to be Julia, sister
to the Marquis de Villeroi, and justly admired by all who saw her:
Her shape was as fine as the statue of the Medician Venus, of as
fine a complexion as the Leda of Corregio, with a sweetness of
expression that would have made Guido paint no other face, if he
had been alive.</p>

<p>The masquerade finished, which had afforded so much
amusement, and conferred so much happiness on the parties.
Lady Bingley was received by Lady Darnley with the utmost
complacency. It is the imperfection of <i>human</i> goodness to make its
conscious worth an argument of want of mercy to those that are
deficient: but Lady Darnley had thoroughly studied the most
useful of all sciences, human nature, and was ever ready to make
allowances for its defects. She was the more attentive to Lady
Bingley, on account of her peculiar situation; while in the
effusions of her gratitude there was a dignity that commanded as
much respect as if she had been conferring a favor beyond that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
she acknowledged. Her relations, who abandoned her in her
adversity&mdash;when alone true friendship can prove its superiority
over its shadow, <i>worldly civility</i>&mdash;were now eager to pay their
compliments to her.</p>

<p>Mr Villars was the only person who appeared unhappy at this
time. Mrs Lee had been hurt at never hearing from him since her
husband's death, and was confirmed that his present appearance
was occasioned more from a concurrence of circumstances than
from his own particular desire or inclination.&mdash;It was in vain he
urged, that his having absented himself from England was
occasioned by her refusing to see him previous to her husband's
death; which circumstance he had been unapprised of, previous to
his meeting the Marquis de Villeroi at Paris.&mdash;She answered,
That he had neither been a lover that had the tenderness, nor a
friend that had the generosity to interest himself for her; though
he must have been sensible of her partiality, from the pains she
took to avoid him:&mdash;that, concerning the strange event that had
occurred relative to her husband and him, she had never taken any
pains to justify herself; and she thought people in general were to
blame that did so; for satire is generally levelled against persons,
not vices, as there are few who wish to punish what does not put
them out of humour, and they make a personal affront the
pretended defender of virtue. If a woman, therefore, would
<i>preserve her character</i>, this is the effectual way <i>of losing it</i>, and if she
has <i>none to preserve</i> she need not tell <i>all the world</i> so.&mdash;'But (said
she) as I must now decline your proffered hand, the offer of which
does more honor to your generosity than the acceptance would to
my prudence, I shall now disclose my sentiments to you without
any disguise:&mdash;I was married to a man, whom I could not look up
to with a consciousness of his superior understanding or worth; his
treatment of me was injurious; my feelings I with difficulty
suppressed: my quick apprehension of injury, and my partiality for
you, made me indulge an inclination that aggravated to me the
horrors of my situation.&mdash;I loved, and was utterly incapable of
divesting myself of a passion, which, although often dangerous, is
always delightful.&mdash;I was punished for my temerity; the calumny I
met with, I justly incurred, from the appearance I had subjected
myself to. When I parted from my husband, I would on no account
see you&mdash;you went abroad; your caprice now brings you back; you
judge it equitable, perhaps, to restore me to that world I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
relinquished on your account&mdash;but time has conquered my
partiality, and, after my former experience in that state, I cannot
help shuddering at a contract which nothing can dissolve but
death. To me it is terrible to reflect, that it is a strangely unequal
conflict, in which the man only ventures the loss of a few
temporary pleasures, the woman the loss of liberty, and almost the
privilege of opinion.&mdash;From the moment she's married she
becomes the subject of an arbitrary lord; even her children, the
mutual pledges of their affection, are absolutely in his power, and
the law countenances him in the use of it&mdash;and a woman finds no
redress for the indelicate abuses of an uncivil, a passionate, and
avaricious, an inconstant, or even a drunken husband&mdash;from
matrimonial decisions there is no appeal.'&mdash;Mr Villars said every
thing to justify himself, adding, that the most candid mind will
sometimes, under certain circumstances, deviate from itself; but it
is the property <i>only</i> of narrow minds to persist in prejudice against
conviction.&mdash;As the quarrels between lovers are the renewal of
love&mdash;these differences were soon settled, agreeable to their
mutual wishes.</p>

<p>Mr Burt testified great joy at the celebration of the nuptials of
his grandson&mdash;That good man died the next day, without any
complaint, with a smile of complacency on his venerable face. In
an age where men of letters seem so regardless of morals&mdash;in an
age where they have endeavoured to persuade mankind, with but
too much success, that the virtues of the mind and of the heart are
incompatible&mdash;let them cast their eyes on the character of Mr
Burt&mdash;When they find so many virtues united in a man, whose
understanding was both sublime and just&mdash;when they find a man
of his penetration to have been a strictly moral man&mdash;they will
then, perhaps, be convinced that vice is the natural effect of an
imperfect understanding.</p>

joué un grand rôle à Paris, y vivoit dans un reduit obscur, victime de l'infortune, et
si indigent qu'il ne subsistoit que des aumônes de la paroisse; on lui remettoit par
semaine la quantité du pain suffisante pour sa nourriture; il en fit demander
davantage; le curé lui écrit pour l'engager à passer chez lui; il vient. Le curé
s'informe s'il vit seul; et avec qui, Monsieur, repond-il, voudriez-vous que je
vécasse? je suis malheureux, vous le voyez, puis que j'ai recours à charité, et tout le
monde m'a abandonné, tout le monde! Mais, Monsieur, continue le curé, si vous
êtes seul, pourquoi demandez vous plus de pain que ce qui vous est necessaire?
L'autre paroit déconcerté; il avoue avec peine qu'il a un chien: le curé ne le laisse
pas poursuivre; il lui fait observer qu'il n'est que le distributeur du pain des
pauvres, et que l'honneteté exige absolument qu'il se defasse de son chien. Eh!
Monsieur, s'ecrie en pleurant l'infortune, si je m'en défais, qui est ce qui
m'aimera? Le pasteur attendri jusqu'aux larmes, tire sa bourse, et la lui donne, en
disant, Prenez, Monsieur ceci m'appartient.'</p></div>

works where they are obliged to use such expressions: '<i>Se havessi nomenato Fato,
Fortuna, Destino, Elysio, Stigé, Etc. sono scarzi di penna poetica, non sentimenti di anema
